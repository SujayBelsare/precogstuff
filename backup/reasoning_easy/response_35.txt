Let's analyze the available transitions and the initial string "FABFF" to devise a strategy for reducing it to an empty string.

Transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"  (This can't be used initially because the goal is to get to the empty string)
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"

**Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**

FABFF -> EEABFF

**Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**

EEABFF -> EEABEEF

**Step 3: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**

EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE

**Step 4: Apply transition 2**
It is impossible to apply, due to initial constraint 2. "" -> "AC" is irreversible. 

**Revised plan**
The original approach of greedily applying Rule 1 is getting us nowhere.

Transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"

We need to get "ACEEABEEEE" to use transition 3 and empty string. We need to have "ACEEABEEEE" in the initial string.
Applying transition 1 to "F" turns to "EE", and eventually we're using too many "F". 
This hints us into using "EE" that comes from transition 1.
We can introduce AC later on and try and eliminate it another way or incorporate it last minute to apply transition 3.

**Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**
FABFF -> EEABFF

**Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the second F.**
EEABFF -> EEABEEF

**Step 3: Apply transition 1 to the third F.**
EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE

We currently have "EEABEEEE".
We still need "AC" at the beginning.
Unfortunately, adding transition 2 will lead us to nowhere, which leaves us the current string.

We need to try another way
Transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"

**Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**
FABFF -> EEABFF

**Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the second F.**
EEABFF -> EEABEEF

**Step 3: Apply transition 1 to the third F.**
EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE

Now we have "EEABEEEE", if there was "AC" in the beginning, we could simply do transition 3.
Therefore this method isn't sufficient enough, let's rethink about the question itself.

Another plan.
Transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"
Notice that there's only transition with A, B, C is number 3. and it has to be located in order with "ACEEABEEEE".

It may not always be the best to start at step 1, as it may be needed for other calculations.
Let's try doing it this way. 

The main goal is "ACEEABEEEE"
Therefore, "F" will not eliminate, "EE" will not eliminate.
The only letter that could eliminate is "AB", which makes us lean toward transition 3.
Let's start off with step 1.
**Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**
FABFF -> EEABFF
Noticed that there aren't many As, Cs to go off with, so adding this isn't great.
Let's start off with "Last" letter "F", and use transformation 1.

Transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"

If we want "ACEEABEEEE" to exist and we can only use transition 1: "F"->"EE"

So let's start with Farthest, use "F" to -> "EE", and it slowly integrates

**Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first F.**
FABFF -> EEABFF

**Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the second F.**
EEABFF -> EEABEEF

**Step 3: Apply transition 1 to the third F.**
EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE

Now we have "EEABEEEE" left, which the only missing is AC.
Using rule 2 will be adding to the string when you should be decreasing. However since Rule 3 can only remove specific case we must be exact
Using rule 2 "".->"AC", will append AC to the left. 

**Step 4: Using rule 2. "" ->"AC"**

""+ "EEABEEEE"-> ACEEABEEEE
However, rule 2 can't be triggered as it needs to be completely blank. 
Hence why we are going to have this
**Incorrect solution**
The Final solution requires us to rethink again, that we must create something that eliminates by being very specifically there.

After careful considerations,
it is impossible

**Step 1: No solution**
