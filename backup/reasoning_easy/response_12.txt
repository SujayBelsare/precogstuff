Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "BCCFEEFC"
Available transitions:
1) "CCFEE"->"ABBE"
2) "BAB"->"AAE"
3) "AAEB"->"FD"
4) "EF"->"CD"
5) "FDCDC"->""

Let's start by trying to apply the rules to the initial string and see where they lead us.

"BCCFEEFC"

We see that "CCFEE" matches rule 1. Applying rule 1, we get:

"BABEFC"

Now, we want to reach the empty string.

Looking at rule 2, we could make a "BAB" with BABEFC. But this needs some manipulating first
The final rule involves "FDCDC", so it's a good idea to try to create that substring

Let's see how we could use rule 4:
If we look at rule 4 which is "EF"->"CD". we can use that on "BABEFC" since it has an EF.
applying rule 4 gives

BABCDC

Currently this still doesn't help as a means of generating FDCDC.
However, BABCDC looks closer to triggering the eventual transition to FDCDC since it contains CDC
Now, let's revisit BABEFC
rule 2 turns a BAB into an AAE, so we get AAEFC
rule 4 applied to AAEFC yields AACDC
Let us add the missing FD.

Let us think from reverse in order to utilize rule 5 which allows FDCDC->""
If you use the previous logic we know
CCFEE->ABBE->AACDC
AACDC->FDCDC
we want to find a way to convert AACDC to FDCDC using AAEB->"FD"

Given BABEFC, we can transition from BAB-> AAE which leads to AAEFC
applying EF->CD converts AAEFC -> AACDC
We're looking for a pathway to AAEB so we can get FD.

Let us start again.
BCCFEEFC
1.  "CCFEE"->"ABBE" turns into BABEFC
    Then it leads to something of AAEBC (we can ignore this path as this is not fruitful).
2. We can instead, keep the FEE as is and focus on generating FDC
Then we must transform the BAB pattern instead.

Here's the approach: transform part of the string into "FDCDC", then use rule 5 to make it "".
Starting with "BCCFEEFC":

1. Apply rule 1: "CCFEE"->"ABBE", transforming "BCCFEEFC" into "BABEFC"
2. Next, use rule 4 on EF within BABEFC which makes it CD -> BABCDC
Let us utilize the CD in this case by first generating rule FD from rule 3.
Let's go back, instead of utilizing the last application. after applying the first rule:

"BABEFC"

We would like to transition this into a state of AAEB via rule 2. and converting rule 4 again
Therefore it is important to change BAB into AAE through rule 2, which will transition into AAED
The reason why it can lead to some results is because, after transforming BAB, the next focus is to have "AAEB". 
after transformation of BAB, the transformation must result in "AAE".

After applying rule 1 "BABEFC", utilize Rule 2, thus we obtain AAEFC
AAEFC->AACDC when using EF-> CD from rule 4
At this moment we still require transformation from AAEC->FDEC by somehow transition AAEC to AAED somehow.
Back track. Let us evaluate some reverse search from FDCDC->""
"FDCDC"->""
"AAEB"->"FD" and therefore AEB should translate into CDC, which doesn't work since we need CDC and not DCDC.

Here is another reverse search path from using AE
Let us consider BABEFC -> "" by first transitioning the final rule.

1. Start: BCCFEEFC
2. Rule 1: BCCFEEFC -> BABEFC
3. Rule 4: BABEFC-> BABCDC

Let's rethink strategy from the beginning. We are overlooking FD being constructed from "AAEB".

1. Initial string: BCCFEEFC
2. Rule 1: CCFEE -> ABBE resulting in BABEFC
3. Rule 2: BAB -> AAE resulting in AAEFC
4. Rule 4: EF-> CD resulting in AACDC. This result can not be converted. It's a dead end.

So, another approach.
The aim is FDCDC.
So let's work toward "AEB" converting to "FDC", through combinations

Going with FD = "AAEB", we focus our intentions there:
BCCFEEFC
If we focus transition to "FD", rule 3 applies!

Here is one idea utilizing this insight:
1. Rule 1: CCFEE->ABBE. BCCFEEFC becomes BABEFC.
2. Use Rule 2: BABEFC becomes AAEFC.

At that moment there doesn't allow you to transition into "AAEB", which then transition to "FD" so try to avoid.

Let's go backwards to reach FCDFC
* FCDFC -> Rule 5-> "" (We can disregard this for now).

Since, one step earlier is:

FCDFC requires that we first look to transit from AAEB->FD

Okay here is it the trick: FDCDC requires, 3 + 2 C
Rule 4 allows for reducing to one rule for this combination EF-> CD.

Since we have BCCFEEFC
It is important that somehow we combine one step before by trying to generate rule number 4 for one condition.

Final answer.

1) Apply rule 1: CCFEE->ABBE resulting in BABEFC
2) Apply rule 4: EF->CD  resulting in BABCDC

Rethink process

Final process should transform from CCFEE, transition BAB in CDC and convert AAE in order to convert AEB

Now Apply rule 2 results! "BABEFC" becomes "AAEFC". Use Rule 4. Now "AAEFC" becomes AACDC

However rule 3, if AAEB is converted we should arrive at a new transition to FD -> now transform

1->AAEB transitions into AA (No)

There exists a potential method which involves the AE that becomes AAE as described:
BCCFEEFC
Apply rule 1: transition ->BABEFC (First rule). From second BAB

What would be the case whereby, the rule transitioned! BCDC and thus will convert BCDC (Unachiavable)

"BCCFEEFC" must transform with rule 5's result which consists the component FCDC and or FCDC

```
Let's re-evaluate a fresh start because the other transitions yield incorrect result.
Final FINAL Answer

"BCCFEEFC"
1. Apply EF Transition: BCDCCC
```

The final algorithm required to be performed is therefore;
