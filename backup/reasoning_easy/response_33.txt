Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully.

Initial string: "ABBFAEABF"
Transitions:
1) "A"->"EF"
2) "EFE"->"EFF"
3) "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

Goal: ""

The large transition (3) to the empty string suggests we need to create the substring "EFBBFEFFEFBF".
Let's try applying transition 1 to convert A's into "EF" gradually and see if we can form the target.

1. Apply transition 1 to the first A:
"ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF"

2. Apply transition 1 to the second A:
"EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFABF"

3. Apply transition 1 to the third A:
"EFBBFEFABF" -> "EFBBFEFEFBF"

Now we have the initial and final substrings in the target "EFBBFEFFEFBF"
Notice that the "EFE" in "EFBBFEFEFBF" looks similar to the left part of rule 3.
Also, EFE appears more than one time in our current string, as well as being close to each other.

4. Apply transition 2 to the first EFE
"EFBBFEFEFBF" -> "EFBBFEFFEFBF"

Now we have exactly the "EFBBFEFFEFBF".
5. Apply transition 3 to the string.
"EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

So the steps are [1, 1, 1, 2, 3].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}$
