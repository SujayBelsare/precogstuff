Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.
Initial string: "FECEA"
Available transitions:
1) "FEC"->"BC"
2) "EA"->"FB"
3) "BCF"->"FD"
4) "FD"->"BA"
5) "BAB"->""

The initial string is FECEA. We want to get to an empty string using the transitions provided. The final transition must be BAB->"". Thus, let's look for a route to derive "BAB".

1. FECEA. The only directly applicable transition is 2: "EA"->"FB".
   FECEA -> FECFB.

2. FECFB. The only directly applicable transition is 1: "FEC"->"BC".
   FECFB -> BCFB.

3. BCFB. The only directly applicable transition is 3: "BCF"->"FD".
   BCFB -> FDFB.

4. FDFB. Apply transition 4 to FD
    FDFB-> BAB
5. BAB. Apply transition 5
    BAB->""
Therefore, the correct order of transitions is [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].
FINAL ANSWER: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
