Let's analyze the given transitions and the initial string "DFBCE". The target is to reach an empty string.

The available transitions are:
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""

Notice that the initial string "DFBCE" appears at the end of the second transition, and transition 2 converts "DDDDDDDDDFBCE" to "". Therefore, our goal should be to transform "DFBCE" into "DDDDDDDDDFBCE". Transition 1 adds "DD" to the end of an empty string; however it cannot be used to arbitrarily introduce "DD" to a non-empty string, thus is unhelpful to add intermediate transformation.

The initial string "DFBCE" does not contain an empty string "", thus transition 1 ""->"DD" cannot be used to begin with.
Since we must reach "DDDDDDDDDFBCE" we need to add "DDDDDDDDD" to the *start* of "DFBCE". We cannot add any other transitions, or use any more operations.

From observation, it is simply impossible to turn "DFBCE" to "" via "DDDDDDDDDFBCE" without the transition adding function to the begining of strings.

Since it's mathematically proven to be solvable, the transitions must be in the other order. Transition 1 means inserting "DD" to the beginning since there is an implicit beginng symbol.
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""
Initial string: "DFBCE"

This problem cannot be solved with these transitions alone.  There's no way to add the "DDDDDDDDD" in front of "DFBCE" to enable the second transition. The first transition only applies when the string is empty, it *creates* "DD" out of nothing, and doesn't allow insertion to the current "DFBCE" string.

However, since we are explicitly told it's mathematically solvable, the only resolution must be through a clever ordering of the rules, or an implicit understanding.

Looking at the example solutions, it can be seen, that if there are no other transitions, a clever insertion of ""->"AA" can turn other chars into "A"
It might be the case that we will insert an "" inside to make DFBCE like  "D"+"DFBCE" to work around some constraints. The first transition is definitely ""->"DD". Then you somehow need to apply it many many times.

After careful consideration and rereading the prompt and rule constraints, it has come to my attention that inserting 'DD' to the beginning requires inserting a blank space to the initial string, something that cannot happen by rules one and two. Also it's not inserting 'DD' to the beginning that will make initial string turn into an empty string.

Given that: 
The available transitions are:
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""

And the initial string is "DFBCE"

We see that the initial string can be changed to an empty string using ""->"DD". The empty character insertion would imply "" + "DFBCE".
Applying transition 1 does not directly solve the problem, but helps prepare the initial string for use of rule number 2.
We can not do anything to the non-blank string of "DFBCE", therefore we must find another interpretation to 'insert' a string.
Since any string ->"" and ""-> "some-other-string", we can solve this.
Let's say the original string IS "" (length 0), transition 1 sets string to "DD". transition 2 now applies iff the string happens to be "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"

From the initial problem "DFBCE", this can't become "".
It can, though, with a more meta perspective, the initial state of DFCEB already exists in its raw sense. As there exist mathematical proofs, that the problem given are solvable; thus we need to use external transitions.
Applying transition one means, add two more chars 'DD' and transition 2 transforms, initial->empty.
We can not modify any part of DFBCE itself.

If we simply apply transformation 2 now, then nothing would happen, the only solution seems to use transition one many times.

There isn't a possible mathematical method that these series of operators that creates "DDDDDDDDDFBCE" from "DFBCE" using transition rules that only have one empty string addition at any time.

So we must assume, this test is invalid or this set of strings can not create an solution to "", therefore it cannot be solvable in any method mathematically.

FINAL ANSWER: Impossible
