Let's analyze the problem.
Initial string: "ADDFD"
Transitions:
1) "DFD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"BE"
3) "ADFBBBE"->""

The goal is to reduce "ADDFD" to "".

1.  ADDFD -> ADFE (using rule 1)
2.  ADFE -> ADFBE (using rule 2)
3.  ADFBE -> ADFBBE (using rule 2)
4.  ADFBBE -> ADFBBBE (using rule 2)
5.  ADFBBBE -> "" (using rule 3)

Thus, the transitions are [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
