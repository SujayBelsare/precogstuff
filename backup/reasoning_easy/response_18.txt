Okay, let's tackle this problem. The initial string is "DBFACCE", and the goal is to reach an empty string using the provided transitions.

Transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

Let's try to apply the rules strategically to manipulate the initial string into "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".

Initial string: "DBFACCE"

1.  **"DBFACCE"**: Observe "FA" can be transformed using Rule 1 to "BD".
2.  Apply Rule 1: "DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE".

Now, we have "DBBDCCE". We need to introduce "EB" somehow to get closer to the target "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". Rule 2 allows insertion of "EB" into an empty string, but we are nowhere near the empty string yet, so Rule 2 is irrelevant in the intermediate state. 

Consider targeting the overall structure, "EBEBEBDBBDCCE." From our current state of "DBBDCCE," we can deduce the minimum insertion required would involve adding "EBEBEB" before "DB". How would we introduce these?

"DBBDCCE" : Is there any way to prepend EBEBEB? Let us think backwards. The target string has "BB", but if we introduced an extra FA somehow, would rule 1 become more useful? Not immediately apparent. Let's shift our approach and explore the opposite idea of reducing portions of the string until rule 3 is useful.
We notice our string has "DBBDCCE" which has a matching "DBBDCCE" in "EBEBEBDBBDCCE", implying we need to introduce "EBEBEB"

Another strategy would be to try reaching the empty string through smaller transformations. But given that only Rule 3 gets us there, this appears futile without some clever application of 1 and 2 to form Rule 3's pattern. Rule 2 only adds EB at the beginning when an empty string exists so lets ignore this until a transformation can get us near to the empty string.

Final Analysis:

The key to solving it involves a "trick": we cannot reach an empty string before reaching the target string given by rule 3. Therefore we must re-examine the problem in terms of making the current string look exactly like "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". Since there's only "DBBDCCE" currently, it comes down to pre-pending three occurrences of "EB", and in the correct sequence i.e. prepending "EBEBEB"
This requires 3 application of rule 2:

"DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE" (Rule 1)
"DBBDCCE" -> "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" - Implies repeated usage of Rule 2

If Rule 2 only worked for the empty string, there will never be a "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". Therefore, the transition has to occur within "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" when it already exists. I made an incorrect assumption. I thought only the first matching substring is modified which means inserting substrings are disallowed.

Okay, I will have to re-examine.
The final string requires "EBEBEB". It's likely these "EB" strings need to exist PRIOR. What if transition #2 added only ONE at a time and had no prereq for being at an empty string?

"DBFACCE"
"DBBDCCE" (rule 1)
No other rules can apply. It is not possible given the current state.
Assuming the sed transition does allow prepending... let's ignore that and just try all different rules to come up with variations of DBFACCE.

Available transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

There HAS to be some kind of trick. What other strategy or assumption am I missing? If prepending isn't possible, the task is straight up impossible as none of the transforms could work. Going backwards from "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" looks just as futile as nothing transitions to those sequences either. We need to rethink some of the core aspects here.

I have tried to create EBEBEB using the limited tools of prepend, replace "FA" but these aren't working in any capacity because the transforms can only apply left to right. Lets change strategy from 'making' the target EBEBEBDBBDCCE and think of this whole approach more granular instead!

Can "DBFACCE" -> "" be done without thinking of it as getting closer to the final solution?
Currently D,B,F,A,C,C,E characters do nothing independently and only in a 'FA' context can it even begin to affect anything. No character can transform individually at any time. Lets start making this less of "trying to make a structure" into breaking/replacing sections from scratch!!
Lets begin simple by breaking FA again and seeing all variations

"DBFACCE"
"DBBDCCE" (rule 1)

Stuck again! It cannot go anywhere else now as neither transformations work. It is now completely understood there must have been hidden/implied rules NOT listed such as either
(1) Allows appending AND prepending
(2) Can use the SAME rule mulitple times IF it is still valid/found

This can't be solved given only 3 transitions alone.

**Apologies. I concede.** It's clear that certain assumptions regarding implicit operations or repeated rule applications beyond the provided restrictions are necessary to derive a solution. The given rules alone, strictly interpreted with "only first match and one-way application," do not provide a pathway to transform "DBFACCE" into an empty string or "EBEBEBDBBDCCE." I cannot solve it.
