Okay, let's tackle this Sed Puzzle.

Initial String: "BBBCAFBDEC"
Available transitions:
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Here's my reasoning:

1. **BBBCAFBDEC** -> (Using rule 1) **BBFFFBCA**
   Applying rule 1 to "CAFBDEC" transforms the initial string to "BBFFFBCA"

2. **BBFFFBCA** -> (Using rule 2) **FEBDCA**
   The "BBFFB" at the beginning matches the rule's pattern.

3. **FEBDCA** -> (Using rule 3) **FFEFFE**
   We have now created the string EBDCA in the original. We need to target "EBDCA" next which transforms it into "FFE".

4. **FFEFFE** -> (Using rule 4) **FFBBC**
    Now using rule 4, we can transform one of the FFE patterns into BBC.

5. **FFBBC** -> (Using rule 5) **""**
   Lastly the BF then BBC, match rule 5, and our entire expression will result in a null string.
Therefore, the solution is:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
