Okay, let's analyze the initial string "889C5CBAABA" and the available transitions to find a solution.

1. **Initial String:** "889C5CBAABA"
2. **Transitions:**
   1) "9C"->"1C7"
   2) "BA"->"B792"
   3) "B792"->"37E"
   4) "37E"->"63D1"
   5) "881C75C63D1A37E"->""

Let's apply transition 1 to the first occurrence of "9C":
"889C5CBAABA" -> "881C75CBAABA" [1]

Now apply transition 2 to the first occurrence of "BA":
"881C75CBAABA" -> "881C75CB792ABA" [2]

Apply transition 2 again to the first "BA":
"881C75CB792ABA" -> "881C75CB792B792A" [2]

Now apply transition 2 again to the first "BA":
"881C75CB792B792A" -> "881C75CB792B792B792" [2]

At this point, it appears this is an incorrect move. Let's revert a few steps and apply transition 2 on "BA" once instead, and look elsewhere

"889C5CBAABA" -> "881C75CBAABA" [1]
"881C75CBAABA" -> "881C75CB792ABA" [2]

Apply transition 2 on "BA" :
"881C75CB792ABA" -> "881C75CB792B792A" [2]

It might be a good time to use transition 3
"881C75CB792B792A" remains the string

Let's go back to "881C75CBAABA" and apply transition 2 again

"881C75CBAABA" -> "881C75CB792ABA" [2]

Let's use transition 2 on "BA":

"881C75CB792B792A" -> "881C75CB792B792A" [2] is correct, so let's attempt using the conversion from "B792" to "37E".

"881C75CB792ABA"
"881C75CB792ABA" -> "881C75C37EABA" [3]

Now use transition 2 "BA"->"B792":
"881C75C37EABA" -> "881C75C37EAB792" [2]
We need "37E" string in place, so we will perform transition 4 now:

"881C75C37EAB792"-> "881C75C63D1AB792" [4]

Apply transition 2 again to "BA"
"881C75C63D1AB792"-> "881C75C63D1B792792" [2]

The ultimate goal here is the apply transition 5 which needs the string "881C75C63D1A37E". We are very close!

Reverting and trying again from 889C5CBAABA

"889C5CBAABA"->"881C75CBAABA" [1]
"881C75CBAABA"->"881C75CB792ABA" [2]
"881C75CB792ABA"->"881C75CB792B792A" [2] Still not leading to transition 5

Backtrack and apply only transition 1.

"889C5CBAABA"->"881C75CBAABA" [1]
"881C75CBAABA"->"881C75CBB792A" [2]
This won't lead anywhere near what we want. I must backtrack to beginning.

"889C5CBAABA"
Apply Transition 1:
"889C5CBAABA" -> "881C75CBAABA" [1]
Apply Transition 2:
"881C75CBAABA" -> "881C75CB792ABA" [2]
Apply Transition 3:
"881C75CB792ABA" ->"881C75C37EABA" [3]
Apply Transition 2:
"881C75C37EABA" -> "881C75C37EAB792" [2]
Apply Transition 4:
"881C75C37EAB792" -> "881C75C63D1AB792" [4]
Apply Transition 3: Doesn't work.

It appears "BA" needs to occur *last*. It is very close now

"889C5CBAABA"
Apply Transition 1:
"889C5CBAABA" -> "881C75CBAABA" [1]
Apply Transition 2:
"881C75CBAABA" -> "881C75CB792ABA" [2]
Apply Transition 3:
"881C75CB792ABA" -> "881C75C37EABA" [3]
Apply Transition 4:
"881C75C37EABA" -> "881C75C63D1ABA" [4]
Apply Transition 2:
"881C75C63D1ABA" -> "881C75C63D1AB792" [2]
Apply Transition 3:
"881C75C63D1AB792" -> "881C75C63D1A37E" [3]
Apply Transition 5:
"881C75C63D1A37E" -> "" [5]

Therefore, the final sequence is [1,2,3,4,2,3,5].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5]
