Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game. The goal is to transform "9E3368D" to "" using the given transitions. I will carefully analyze the transitions and the initial string to find a valid solution.

Initial String: "9E3368D"

Available Transitions:
1) "33"->"DA"
2) "8"->"25"
3) "A62"->"59C7"
4) "ED5"->"E7"
5) "E79"->"3D"
6) "DC7"->"1B"
7) "931B5D"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to replace the first occurrence of "33" with "DA".
"9E3368D" -> "9EDA68D"
Transition applied: 1

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to replace the first occurrence of "8" with "25".
"9EDA68D" -> "9EDA625D"
Transition applied: 2

Step 3: Apply transition 3 to replace the first occurrence of "A62" with "59C7".
"9EDA625D" -> "9ED59C75D"
Transition applied: 3

Step 4: Apply transition 4 to replace the first occurrence of "ED5" with "E7".
"9ED59C75D" -> "9E79C75D"
Transition applied: 4

Step 5: Apply transition 5 to replace the first occurrence of "E79" with "3D".
"9E79C75D" -> "93DC75D"
Transition applied: 5

Step 6: Apply transition 6 to replace the first occurrence of "DC7" with "1B".
"93DC75D" -> "931B5D"
Transition applied: 6

Step 7: Apply transition 7 to replace "931B5D" with "".
"931B5D" -> ""
Transition applied: 7

Solution: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
