Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game problem with initial string "9C48701F4" and the given transitions.

1. **Initial String:** "9C48701F4"

2. **Apply rule 1:** "01"->"7A0". The initial string becomes "9C4877A0F4"

3. **Apply rule 2:** "77A0F"->"487774A". The initial string becomes "9C48487774A4"

4. **Apply rule 3:** "4848"->"AB". The initial string becomes "9CAB7774A4"

5. **Apply rule 5:** "7774"->"A28C4". The initial string becomes "9CAB A28C4 A4" which is equivalent to "9CABA28C4A4"

6. **Apply rule 6:** "28C"->"48374". The initial string becomes "9CABA483744A4"

7. **Apply rule 4:** "9C"->"FD". The initial string becomes "FDABA483744A4"

8. **Apply rule 7:** "FDABA483744A4"->"" The initial string becomes ""

Therefore, the correct sequence of transitions is: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7]

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7]
