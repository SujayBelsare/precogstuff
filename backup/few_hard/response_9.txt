Okay, let's analyze the problem to find the optimal solution.

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"
Available transitions:
1) "8"->"81"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

The goal is to convert the initial string to an empty string. Notice transition 3 is a very powerful one, so we should try to construct it.

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"
Apply transition 1 to the first "8":
"8BB86503B248" -> "81BB86503B248" (Transition 1)

Apply transition 1 multiple times to create "811111". To make it easier, let's define a transition "8" -> "81" as T1.

"81BB86503B248" -> Apply T1 on the "8" -> "811BB86503B248"
Repeatedly applying T1 until we have 811111 in correct place gives the right solution! 

However, it will never solve the initial question of emptying the string. We see we need to apply rule 3: "DC811111BB86503B248"->"" but our initial string does NOT have the DC in the beginning so we need to use rule 2: ""->"DC". The problem is that rule 2 only works on empty strings and does not allow insertion.
This strategy of using Rule 2 cannot apply, as the initial string is NOT empty, and rule 2 is only applicable to empty strings! We must figure out a way to use rule 3! The other rule is only helpful in concatenating strings (Rule 1).

Okay, it appears that our initial reasoning was faulty. Instead of blindly trying to create the prefix for rule 3, lets try to find an inductive reasoning instead!
The end result we are looking for is "". 
Lets analyze rule 3 carefully:
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"

Okay. It's impossible. There is no way of introducing DC using only transitions 1 and 3. Rule 2 is not a valid step, since initial condition does not begin with an empty string.
Because this contradicts that all solutions given are solvable, let's try a different tact, and see if we can find a trick somewhere else in the statement of the problem.
We cannot create "DC" except from the empty string (using transition 2) but initially our string is "8BB86503B248", which is not an empty string, so we can never use transition 2!

Aha! I understand. Since the question asks for all transitions and explicitly states that order MATTERS, then consider the possibility of doing nothing.
The way the rules are implemented is such that transition is only applied to FIRST match substring. 

But, this requires an initial string "". But the string cannot be empty at first step.

Consider applying rules 1 as much as we want to "8". This becomes arbitrarily large by rules of one direction. 
Thus, rules must result into deleting ALL initial substrings from rule 3!

There appears to be no clear solution.

Let's re-evaluate available transition:
1) "8"->"81"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

And initial string is "8BB86503B248"
I made an oversight. I missed a solution. Let's evaluate this
apply 1 multiple times will NOT help at all. because after the operation you will STILL have the initial string and will not terminate the operation

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[]}$
