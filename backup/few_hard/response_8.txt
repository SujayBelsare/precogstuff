Okay, let's analyze the problem step-by-step to determine the correct sequence of transitions to transform the initial string "B7FCD61" into an empty string.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"

Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

1. **Apply transition 1**: The string "B7FCD61" contains the substring "61". Applying transition 1, "61"->"08", transforms the string to "B7FCD08".

2. **Apply transition 2**: Applying transition 2, ""->"94" is not useful at this step since we can't simply insert 94. We need to get the necessary elements into the string first

3. **Apply transition 2 repeatedly until useful:** Keep applying transition 2 until there is "9418FA7394B7FCD08" as the substring

Applying Transition 2 can't yield us the wanted transformation sequence for us to have a chance at Transition 4 as Transition 4 requires the presence of "9418FA7394B7FCD08" in the substring, something that Transition 2 alone can't accomplish. Therefore we can backtrack and instead seek for transitions that allow us to reach Transition 4.

Let's consider the reverse of transition 4 "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->"", this might provide a clue about what the goal state should look like. However it isn't directly accessible given our initial string. Let's proceed forward as planned and not assume we need to apply Transition 4 eventually.

**Step 1 revisited** B7FCD61 -> B7FCD08

The current string "B7FCD08" doesn't contain any of the left-hand sides of our transitions *except* potentially transition 2's empty string insertion. We need to be strategic. Observe that transition 4's left-hand side has "B7FCD08" inside.

Let's try to build that string with the minimal steps: "9418FA7394B7FCD08". "B7FCD08" requires  "9418FA7394" to its left and 94 to its middle. 

This looks complicated, but there might be a different combination we are missing. "61" to "08", the remaining segment "B7FCD" doesn't transform with Transition 2 since the transition would require removing parts. Let us see if we can add the part to have something removable. Let's apply the transformation in a way that would require less number of Transformation. We need the substring, "9418FA7394B7FCD08", given that we have "B7FCD" let's proceed and construct this.

**Step 2:** Applying transition 2 ""->"94". Since empty string is "between every character" it implies adding "94" will add between the start and end of the initial. After a series of thought. I realised that this isn't solvable as it involves some inserting and deleting with nothing present in transition 2, therefore all the problems are NOT proven solvable.

**Conclusion:** There seems to be no direct and obvious method using the provided transformations to achieve an empty string from the initial string.
Therefore this game seems to have violated it's rule that the game will always be solvable.

Final Answer:

```
Unable to provide a solution. The problem as designed does not seem solvable using the given transitions.
