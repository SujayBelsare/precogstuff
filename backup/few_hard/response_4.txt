Okay, let's analyze the initial string "3A0FD2EF" and the available transitions to reach an empty string.

1.  Initial String: "3A0FD2EF"

2.  Apply transition 1: "0FD"->"89" on "3A0FD2EF"
    String becomes: "3A892EF"

3.  Apply transition 2: "EF"->"2B" on "3A892EF"
    String becomes: "3A8922B"

4.  Apply transition 3: "A8922B"->"4F6AAE" on "3A8922B"
    String becomes: "34F6AAE"

5.  Apply transition 4: "3"->"337" on "34F6AAE"
    String becomes: "3374F6AAE"

6. Since "3374F6AAE" does not contain any string that matches with our rules, we can't apply any rules directly
    But "0C" doesn't appear anywhere. so using this as part of our strategy is useless
    We require  "0C0C3374F6AAE" but "0C" cannot be created, thus our original solution does not work. We need to backtrack

Let's try a different route.
1.  Initial String: "3A0FD2EF"

2.  Apply transition 2: "EF"->"2B" on "3A0FD2EF"
    String becomes: "3A0FD22B"

3. Apply transition 1: "0FD"->"89" on "3A0FD22B"
    String becomes: "3A8922B"

4.  Apply transition 3: "A8922B"->"4F6AAE" on "3A8922B"
    String becomes: "34F6AAE"

5.  Apply transition 4: "3"->"337" on "34F6AAE"
    String becomes: "3374F6AAE"

Here, we reach a point where the only rule remaining has '0C', so it must be a part of the end goal somehow

Let's explore generating this "0C". But empty to something is not useful in reducing "3A0FD2EF" -> "".
So how would it work:
Suppose string is: "3A0FD2EF"
What must be a next state. To use Rule 6 we need: "0C0C3374F6AAE", but before it, need: "3374F6AAE" before that, need: "34F6AAE"

1. Start:"3A0FD2EF"
2. 0FD -> 89  :"3A892EF" (Rule 1)
3. EF -> 2B : "3A8922B" (Rule 2)
4. A8922B -> 4F6AAE:"34F6AAE" (Rule 3)
5. 3 -> 337: "3374F6AAE" (Rule 4)
6. "" -> 0C cannot be used without reducing first! This means Rule 6 won't work

Final Analysis: Rules not sufficient to make Initial State to final state. Therefore no possible solution

```python
def solve():
    print("The provided rules and initial string do not lead to a solution that ends with an empty string.")

solve()
```
FINAL ANSWER: Impossible
