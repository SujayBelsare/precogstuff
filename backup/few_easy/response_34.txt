Let's analyze the initial string "BBBCAFBDEC" and the available transitions to find a valid solution.

Initial string: "BBBCAFBDEC"

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "BBBCAFBDEC":

BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFFBCA

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "BBBFFBCA":

BBBFFBCA -> BBFEBDCA

Step 3: Apply transition 3 to "BBFEBDCA":

BBFEBDCA -> BBFFFE

Step 4: Apply transition 4 to "BBFFFE":

BBFFFE -> BBBBC

Step 5: Apply transition 5 to "BBBBC":

BBBBC -> ""

Therefore, the sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}$
