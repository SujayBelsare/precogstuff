Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to reduce "FECEA" to an empty string.

Initial string: "FECEA"
Available transitions:
1) "FEC"->"BC"
2) "EA"->"FB"
3) "BCF"->"FD"
4) "FD"->"BA"
5) "BAB"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "FECEA".  "FEC" at the beginning matches.
FECEA -> BCEA

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "BCEA". "EA" matches.
BCEA -> BC*FB*

Step 3: Currently, we have BCFB. Apply transition 3 "BCF"->"FD"
BCFB->*FD*B

Step 4: Now we have FDB. Apply transition 4 "FD"->"BA"
FDB-> *BA*B

Step 5: We have BAB. Apply transition 5.
BAB -> ""

Solution: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
