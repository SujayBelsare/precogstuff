Let's start with the initial string "DAFBA". The goal is to reach "".

Available transitions:
1) "B"->"FC"
2) ""->"FB"  (Important: This adds "FB" at the beginning)
3) "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

"DAFBA"

First, let's try eliminating the 'B'. Using transition 1): "B"->"FC".
DAFBA -> DAFFCA  [1]

Now we have "DAFFCA". We need to somehow use transition 3: "FFCFBDAFFCA"->"". We can only use transition 1 on an existing 'B'.  Transition 2 is no use as its empty -> not useful here.

Current: "DAFFCA"

The critical piece to observe here is transition #3 contains BDA, yet we have D. Let's transform our string to include 'B', through transformation 2 ""->"FB". Because of rule #2 saying transitions modify the first instance ONLY we cannot modify 'DAFFCA'.

The puzzle is incorrect or has unsolvable issues; transition #2 cannot ever be called because we must modify the *first* match ONLY. Transition #2 will never be useful, since after transition #1 the string "B" is gone. No transition from the set can remove the remaining letters.
Let's analyze the statement saying "It is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable."

Assuming, even if, that insertion occurred at arbitrary locations (contrary to stated rules) after DAFFCA from our previous deductions, FFBDAFFCA would never occur with insertion of 'FB'.

Therefore, there are NO valid transitions possible.
Therefore, there is something deeply wrong with this particular problem.

Final Answer:
There is NO possible solution. I must invoke mathematical contradiction.
