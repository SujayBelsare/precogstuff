Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle. The initial string is "BCEEF". The available transitions are:

1) "CEEF"->"AC"
2) ""->"CD"
3) "CDCDCDBAC"->""

We want to reduce "BCEEF" to an empty string.

First, let's apply transition 1 to the initial string "BCEEF":

BCEEF -> BAC (applying "CEEF"->"AC")

Now, we have "BAC". Unfortunately, no available transition works on "BAC" directly.

Consider building the string "CDCDCDBAC", which can be deleted directly via rule 3.

From the beginning "BCEEF" apply rule 1 to get BAC, if we add CDCDCDBAC after BAC the result is BACCDCDCDBAC. It appears that using the insertion operation provided by rule 2 ""->"CD" to construct this string doesn't reduce anything that starts with the initial string so that is unlikely to lead to a solution. It may be required, however, so lets keep this in mind. 

Since we start with BCEEF applying the first rule appears correct. Applying the first rule to get BAC we need to find operations that would yield "CDCDCDBAC" if prefixed by "BAC" we would have: BACCDCDCDBAC, if this became "" using just rule 3 would work, but that requires the input be CDCDCDBAC. Rule 3 is used to delete "CDCDCDBAC" when present, so let us evaluate what strings might lead to it via application of either the rule to produce CDCDCDBAC via rule 1 or 2. Rule 2 only produces "CD", and rule 1 converts CEEF to AC, which is unlikely to directly yield "CDCDCDBAC"

Since we've ruled out rules 2 & 3 initially, maybe we need to start inserting CD via rule 2 at the start.
"" -> "CD", therefore "BCEEF" can become "CDBCEEF". No.
Rule 2 expands "", which means that no operations currently have a means to get us to "" since there must be characters to begin. As a result this problem cannot be solved. However we can apply Rule 1 to yield BAC:

BCEEF -> BAC (using rule 1)

It is impossible to further reduce BAC since no available transition exists to transform it. The problem is thus unsolveable.
