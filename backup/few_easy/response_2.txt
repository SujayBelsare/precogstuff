Let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "CADBB"

Available transitions:
1) "DBB"->"DF"
2) "CADF"->"ADF"
3) "A"->"AD"
4) "ADDDF"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "CADBB". The first match of "DBB" is at the end of the string.
CADBB -> CADF
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "CADF". The first match of "CADF" is at the beginning of the string.
CADF -> ADF
[1, 2]

Step 3: Apply transition 3 to "ADF". The first match of "A" is at the beginning of the string.
ADF -> ADDF
[1, 2, 3]

Step 4: Apply transition 3 to "ADDF". The first match of "A" is at the beginning of the string.
ADDF -> ADDDF
[1, 2, 3, 3]

Step 5: Apply transition 4 to "ADDDF". The first match of "ADDDF" is at the beginning of the string.
ADDDF -> ""
[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Final Answer: The solution is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4].
