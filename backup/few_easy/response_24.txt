Let's analyze the initial string "EDFDDBECF" and the available transitions to find a path to an empty string.

Initial String: "EDFDDBECF"

Transitions:
1) "CF"->"DF"
2) "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
3) ""->"CB" (This can't be directly applied until the string is empty)
4) "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 "CF"->"DF" to "EDFDDBECF".
Result: "EDFDDDECF"
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 1 "CF"->"DF" to "EDFDDDECF".
Result: "EDFDDDEDF"
[1, 1]

Now let's consider applying rule 2 and consider if we could then transition to rule 4 to remove the whole string. Rule 2 transitions "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE". "EDFDDDEDF" would need two applications of transition rule 1 and then you would use transition 2, but this doesn't appear to be effective. Instead we should look to get EDFDDBE earlier, for an application of rule 2. The transitions would thus change to EDFDDDEC and so the first application of rule 1 makes sense. If we could get E to then be turned into C, that may allow an approach via rule 4.

So lets consider an iterative step of replacing CF by DF, to try and reach a CBCBEBAEEDF. Let's attempt applying transitions:

EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDDECF -> EDFDDDEDF (Steps 1 and 2 were a right approach from previous failed attempts)
Now consider EDFDDDEDF.

If we apply rule 1 here on a theoretical *final DF, EDFDDDEDF, this isn't a valid matching on rule 1 because it only acts on the first transition.
Let's investigate what happens after using rule 2 initially instead. If EDFDDBECF --> EBAEECF --> EBAEEDF. Is this viable towards the final step of Rule 4? EBAEEDF looks good from right-hand-side.

Going back to square one: "EDFDDBECF".

Step 1: Applying rule 2 "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE" to "EDFDDBECF".
Result: "EBAEECF"
[2]
Step 2: Applying rule 1 "CF"->"DF" to "EBAEECF".
Result: "EBAEEDF"
[2, 1]

Now the string is "EBAEEDF". Now, we must introduce "CBCBE", however, transitions 3 is unusable.
Consider a new approach.

Step 1: "EDFDDBECF" -> "EDFDDDECF" [1]
Step 2: "EDFDDDECF" -> No other useful applications here with rules available.

Rule 4 = CBCBEBAEEDF -> "". Let's try making this first by introducing the right things first. We have EDFDDBECF to ""

It appears that the only useful operations are steps 1 and 2 and then step 4. Let's start backward reasoning from step 4's "CBCBEBAEEDF":

"CBCBEBAEEDF". Needs to eventually be transitioned back into "EDFDDBECF" in that form through some applications of previous transitions. If there were a "DF" --> "CF", the order could change as follows, based on string matching:
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDDECF --> CBCBEBAEEDF but there's no way to turn "EDFDDBE" into "CBCBEBAEE" directly other than replacing 2. "EBAEEDF".

Okay, the correct answer to this puzzle relies on first using transitions #1 until all of CF substrings have been removed in the leftmost possible forms and then transitions 2 if possible, because there is no turning "DF" back to CF! Given what transitions are available this can be observed now by testing all cases.
If step 1 were applied to move towards that form. It has been shown.
Thus if step 1 must apply before 2 or we'll eventually run into a dead end

Initial: "EDFDDBECF"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 ("CF"->"DF"): "EDFDDBECF" -> "EDFDDDECF" [1]

We need to transform "EDFDDDECF" into something from which we can obtain "CBCBEBAEEDF".
Now, if step 1 could also work such as step 4, that would be possible. "CBCBEBAEEDF"

No more apparent options with rule 1 without running around in circles again, nor with rule 3 in particular. Therefore, let's backtrack using Step 2 next:

EDFDDBECF --> EBAEECF using rule 2 [2]
Now, EBAEECF needs CBCBEBAEEDF
Using the given rules EBAEECF --> EBAEEDF  [1] which helps

CBCBEBAEEDF doesn't show here, it needs CBCBE (from emptiness for now to "CF" if emptiness existed in rule 3.

There isn't another possible move! As always with empty strings we are stuck again. Let's revisit

"EDFDDBECF" -->  EDFDDDECF[1], no immediate gains using transitions that convert to rule 4's leftmost possible match
or transition rule 2's match (as stated beforehand): [1] -> EDFDDDECF with no clear ending states

But here is where we're making a mistake in evaluation! With *abstractions*:
CF = A
DF = B
E = C
B = D

CBCBEBAEEDF->CCDCEDCCEBDF --> E = C

Since B can always turn to DF (CBCBEBAEEDF): "" needs to go to CB CBCBEBAEEDF  because everything transitions

"EDFDDBECF" is also E [CBCBEBAEEDF]! Thus

"" is the last option in these rules. Now how do we transition? It seems we can loop around endlessly due to lack of proper ordering of replacements/regex replacement properties

THE ANSWER is impossibly due to a lacking ordering condition.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Imposible}$
