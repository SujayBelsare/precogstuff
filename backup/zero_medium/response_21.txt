Okay, I understand. I will attempt to transform the initial string "FEBACDD" into an empty string "" using the given transitions, reasoning carefully at each step and providing the list of transitions used. My goal is to avoid incorrect answers to avoid termination.

Initial string: "FEBACDD"

1. Look for possible transitions in the initial string. Transition 1 ("EBA"->"BAFBB"), Transition 2 ("BC"->"EC"), Transition 3 ("FBA"->"BA"), and Transition 5 ("BABECDD"->"") are not directly applicable. But Transition 4 ("FBE"->"BB") could be useful in the future. Let's apply transition 3: "FBA"->"BA".
String becomes: "EBACDD". Transition: 3

2. Now the string is "EBACDD". Apply transition 1 ("EBA"->"BAFBB").
String becomes: "BAFBBCDD". Transition: 1

3. Now the string is "BAFBBCDD". Looking at the transition list. The transitions that could be used are Transition 2 ("BC"->"EC"). Applying transition 2 ("BC"->"EC").
String becomes: "BAFBECDD". Transition: 2

4. The string is "BAFBECDD". The string can have the transition Transition 4 ("FBE"->"BB"). Applying transition 4 ("FBE"->"BB").
String becomes: "BABBCDD". Transition: 4

5. The string is "BABBCDD". The string can be changed into Transition 5 ("BABECDD"->""). So the strategy should change "BABBCDD" into "BABECDD" first. Using transition 2: "BC"->"EC". Applying Transition 2.
String becomes: "BABECDD". Transition: 2

6. The string is "BABECDD".  Apply Transition 5 ("BABECDD"->"").
String becomes: "". Transition: 5

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5]}$
