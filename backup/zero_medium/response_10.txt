Okay, let's begin. The initial string is "BCBADDCC". We want to reach "".

1.  **BCBADDCC**: We don't have a direct transition. The only available transformation now might be `A`->`DF`. Apply rule 2: `A`->`DF`. The string becomes BCBADDFDCC. This doesn't look promising since we introduce more 'D's and 'F's. So, instead of applying `A`->`DF` right away, let's look for other transitions.
2.  **BCBADDCC**:  Consider the transition `DDC`->`ED`. Apply rule 1: `DDC`->`ED`. This gives us `BCBADEED`.

3.  **BCBADEED**: This string has 'A', so let's try rule 2, `A`->`DF`. Apply rule 2, `A`->`DF`: `BCBADFED`.

4.  **BCBADFED**: I don't see immediately applicable transformations that simplifies to the goal. The path is incorrect. Reset

5.  **BCBADDCC**: Back to the start. Let's try to transform `DDC` to `ED` again.
    `BCBADDCC` -> `BCBAEDC`. Apply Rule 1 (`DDC`->`ED`).

6.  **BCBAEDC**: Now, we look at the list and can see rule 3. BCBDFEDC -> BECF. Rule 3 is similar, let's attempt to create an identical string. We can insert D and F characters with transitions 2 or 4.
    Now apply `A`->`DF`. Result is `BCBDFEDC`. Apply rule 2.

7.   **BCBDFEDC**: Now, transition 3 (`BCBDFEDC`->"BECF") is directly applicable:  `BCBDFEDC` becomes `BECF`.

8.  **BECF**: We don't see an immediate transition that empties out.
9.  **BECF**:  Let's explore transition `F`->"FD" which will not allow the string to empty. Transition 5's input is `BECFDD`. To approach BECFDD, let us try inserting a `DD`. Not sure how we can achieve `DD` without introducing `A->DF`.
10. **BECF**: Resetting. Maybe the first transition `DDC`->`ED` was not the best approach. Instead let's explore if the use of `A` -> `DF` is a correct first step.

11. **BCBADDCC**: Apply transition 2 `A`->`DF`, so `BCBADDFDCC`.
12. **BCBADDFDCC**: Still unable to use the list. Reset. Maybe the start itself is wrong.

13. **BCBADDCC**: Realizing that rule 3 involves multiple letters in `BCBDFEDC`->`BECF`. Is it possible to rewrite in this format? Let's try making rule 3: BCBDFEDC. Notice that 'ADDCC' needs to transform to 'BDFEDC', and we can turn 'A' to 'DF' using rule 2, getting us BCDFDCC. Not quite what we expect.

14. **BCBADDCC**: The only two transitions available initially are 1: DDC->ED, and 2: A -> DF
    Let's explore transition `DDC`->`ED`: Now apply transition 1: `DDC`->`ED`. `BCBAEDC`.

15. **BCBAEDC**: Try `A` -> `DF` again: so it becomes BCBDFEDC. Apply rule 2.
16. **BCBDFEDC**: Now we can directly apply rule 3: BCBDFEDC -> BECF.

17. **BECF**: Need to see how to transition `BECF` -> ''. The trick lies in rule 5: `BECFDD`->"" so BECF needs `DD` appended.

18. **BECF**: Maybe introducing `F->FD` could lead to applying rule 4, 5, which gives a double `D`. Try `F`->`FD`: so, BECF -> BECFD. Apply rule 4.
19. **BECFD**: Not making progress.

20. **BECF**: Reconsidering route after transformation using Rule 3. Note the transition `F`->"FD". Applying to previous, gives `BECFD`.
21. **BECFD**: Can't make a lot of progress, `A`->`DF` introduces F again which results in complex logic. Is it actually the end state of `"BECF"` after the 3 transformation which seems incorrect?

22. **BCBADDCC**: Start from fresh. Let's reconsider. After deep thinking. We transform using these steps to get `"BECF"` via transformations `1, 2, 3`. This is fine and verifiable. **The tricky part lies in emptying BECF**. Reset

23. **BCBADDCC**: Let's note all transformations to the required ones directly: From our knowledge after several attempts.
    First do `1`, gives "BCBAEDC"
    Second do `2`, gives "BCBDFEDC"
    Third do `3`, gives "BECF"

24. **BECF**: Observe that `transition 5: BECFDD->""`, will be applied as `""` on the FIRST substring. Hence we want our previous value to be `BECFDD`. How do we achieve this goal given we know the possible transformations. We'll require two `D`. And `F` becomes `FD` via `Rule 4`, resulting in one `D`. Hence two transformation of Rule `4` is required. `F` to become two `D`.

25. **BECF**: `BECF`. Start with: Transform using `Rule 4 : F -> FD` resulting: `"BECFD"`.
26. **BECFD**: Still require a `D`. Apply Rule 4 again: F->FD which gives us BECFDD
27. **BECFDD**: Now we have reach here successfully and is the exact match from our earlier note and thinking `transition 5: BECFDD->""`, which gives our desire `""`. Applying `Rule 5`: `BECFDD -> ""` will transform to the output string: ""

Now reconstruct all transformations to complete the output list.

The list of transition will be: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`
1) BCBADDCC -> BCBAEDC (Rule 1)
2) BCBAEDC -> BCBDFEDC (Rule 2)
3) BCBDFEDC -> BECF (Rule 3)
4) BECF -> BECFD (Rule 4)
5) BECFD -> BECFDD (Rule 4)
6) BECFDD -> "" (Rule 5)
FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
