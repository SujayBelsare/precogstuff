Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "CEEAC"
Available transitions:
1) "AC"->"FC"
2) "EEFC"->"CE"
3) "C"->"CEAFBF"
4) "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE"->""

Here's the reasoning:

1. **CEEAC -> CEEFC** (Applying rule 1 "AC"->"FC")
2. **CEEFC -> CCE** (Applying rule 2 "EEFC"->"CE")
3. **CCE -> CEAFBFCE** (Applying rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF")
4. **CEAFBFCE -> CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE** (Applying rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF")
5. **CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE -> ""** (Applying rule 4 "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE"->"")

Therefore, the solution is:

[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
