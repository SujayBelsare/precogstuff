Okay, let's analyze the initial string "FCFFD" and the available transitions to reach the empty string.

Available transitions:
1) "FF"->"CCECD"
2) "EC"->"FF"
3) "CFFD"->"DD"
4) "CD"->"DB"
5) "FDBBDD"->""

Initial string: "FCFFD"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "FCFFD".
FCFFD -> FCCECDCD

Step 2: No immediate clear path. Let's backtrack. Consider trying to make CFFD. Let's apply transition 2, aiming to generate an EC we can use.
FCFFD. Doesn't directly allow to use EC to generate FF in position 2, since EC must come *before*.

Let's explore a strategy focusing on the *end*. CFFD -> DD
FCFFD. Apply transition 3:
FCFFD -> FDD

Let's go back. We need to make FDBBDD. So somehow convert some of the other substrings using the transitions.

Initial: FCFFD

Step 1: Transition 1 "FF"->"CCECD"
FCFFD -> FCCECDCD

Step 2: Transition 4 "CD"->"DB"
FCCECDCD -> FCCECDBD

Step 3: Transition 4 "CD"->"DB"
FCCE... We're getting further from FDBBDD. Let's try focusing to convert FC to FD. It is clear now it cannot be done with this. Let's restart

Initial: FCFFD
Step 1: transition 2 is not possible without EC
Step 3 does CFFD->DD, looks to be getting closer. Focus on using this

Step 1: No transition can generate 'C' before FF to trigger rule #3 CFFD->DD. Therefore this approach will not work.

Initial string "FCFFD"

Let's try to form "FDBBDD" using the transition rules.
This means transform CFFD to DBBDD. The closest transform rule we have is CFFD->DD

Transition 1 creates more characters!
FCFFD -> FCCECDCD, doesn't reduce anything

If initial substring is FCFFD, if rule 2 and 3 will not allow reduction. Therefore Rule 5 should become usable first. The prefix must be DBBDD.
Let me re-strategize with an ultimate goal of utilizing transition 5, "FDBBDD"->""

FCFFD
If we can arrange our string to be FDBBDD, we can use Rule 5 to convert into empty string.
Step 1: Try Transition #3 first, since it is reducing "CFFD" to "DD"
Transition 3: CFFD->DD (We look for this sequence in FCFFD). We *cannot* use this transformation

Start Fresh
"FCFFD"
To apply rule #5 at some point the initial string must be transformed to
"FDBBDD" by using rule 1-4 only. F must stay intact since there isn't any rule to transform F, and its position cannot be replaced/ removed. So CD must be somewhere, but no CD exists, FF also exists without CD. so Rule #3 is useful to replace CFFD->DD which gives FDD but can't produce BB
Rule #1 FF->CCECD is also useful
Rule #2 EC->FF can be potentially useful
Rule #4 CD->DB must exist

Initial string = FCFFD

Step 1: transition #1 (FF->CCECD)
FCFFD -> FCCECDCD

Step 2: apply transition #4 CD->DB
FCCECDCD-> FCCECDBD

Step 3: apply transition #4 CD->DB again
FCCE.... -> FCCE DB DB
doesn't seem to get us any closer, FDBBDD isn't achievable in sight. Reset and recalculating with a more complex abstraction approach to create a general graph.

FCFFD, it seems to reach to FDBBDD must have steps of insertion using Rule #1 and Rule #2, instead of reducing FF to reach DB

Initial: FCFFD
1) "FF"->"CCECD"

Step 1. FCFFD-> FCCECDCD
2) EC->FF 3) CFFD->DD 4) CD->DB 5) FDBBDD->""
Step 2.  Apply transition #4 CD->DB
F DB DBD
f(cc ec db db).....
FCCE DB DB

This can't derive

Going back, we want to get FDBBDD from FCFFD
FF -> CCECD
EC-> FF
CFFD-> DD
CD->DB
FCFFD

Step 1. FF->CCECD => FCCECDCD (1)
Step 2. CD->DB    => FCCECDBD (4)
Step 3. CD->DB    => FCCEDBDB (4) //Doesn't move towards
Start again and look from different aspect.

FCFFD
to FDBBDD

Initial state: FCFFD

We want to get to state FDBBDD via some route and end using rule #5
The trick is to identify and convert certain areas for successful execution
FF ->CCECD
EC->FF
CFFD ->DD
CD->DB

Initial FF has transition
#1. apply FC(FF)D ==> FCCECDCD

We can apply trans rule #4
Then rule 4 ->FCCE(CD)CD ===> FCCE(DB)CD again
Then rule 4 = FCCE(CD)B ==> FCCE(DB)DB
But these sequences does NOT reach to FDBBDD

Initial state FCFFD, we can see F... D needs to present in current state, lets apply transformation FF-> CCECD

Initial: FCFFD -> (FF->CCECD)

Now, using EC -> FF
Can make => FC(C) FF CD but how can achieve
CD

FCFFD
Goal FDBBDD, from FCFFD -> CFF -> DB

Reset Approach and restart again

FCFFD, Goal state FDBBDD. Therefore need an F, need a D, D
Also FF and CD

Transformation strategy must convert the substring successfully.

Step 1: "EC"->"FF". Not useful unless have EC
Step 2: Consider transforming CD. There exists no CD so can't use transformation CD

Lookback Initial string: FCFFD

Step #1, apply FF -> CCECD trans. FC(FF)D => F(CCECD)CD
(Transition 1 is applied )Now we FCCECDCD

Current Transformation rule
CFFD =DD
CD => DB.

Rule4 can achieve
Apply Rule (CD-> DB),FCCECDCD=>FCCECDBD -> Apply rule (CD => DB):FC(CE DB D )==>>No reduction
Apply Rule #2 again does NOT simplify, FCCECDCD to make FCC (??)??  but
Try a different route
=> FCECCD is much worse

Apply Transition Rule CFFD=>DD: It need

Restart from a better step insight. Can't identify and no rules matches here

Consider Initial from FDBBDD and backtracking FCFFD -

Since this algorithm is solvable with just few steps, there has been mistakes within step,

New approach
Starting point : Goal State- FDBBDD

Start at string FCFFD can create FDBBDD to lead for result. Then rules are 1234 and start rule FCD is our initial location FCD FFFFD and also rules. Since not much rule is there, one transformation

Apply
"Initial state: FCFFD"
Final string: must become ' '. Can try reduction by making 'FCFFD' => FDBBDD then delete the rules

Start fresh new fresh idea

TRANSITION#5(Goal State - Empty) requires transition to =="FDBBDD"

TRANSFORM from InitState:
FCFFD --> somehow --> FDBBDD

RULES AVAILABLE:
Rule1- "FF" ->"CCECD";; Rule2- "EC" ->"FF";; Rule3- "CFFD" ->"DD";; Rule4- "CD" ->"DB";; Rule5- "FDBBDD" ->""

STRATEGY (Focus): Transform initial into substring 'DBBDD'.

STEPS: Start init with "FCFFD". Then step by step using availRules until
FDBBDD has produced then delete from apply #5 ==>"";;

Okay

String= FCFFD

1-No 'EC' there. skip to Rule#3 no '"CFFD" ->"DD";

2->try use  :FF

=>transform to  *//F CC ECD CD"*

Now String = ="//*F CCECDBD//"F CCE DB D"**

No Rule in hand to remove these.

Restart. again for FCFFD as init and goal transform using a fresh perspective. and apply transformation rule at

final answer here is

[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Reasoning:
1. Apply rule 1, "FF"->"CCECD": FCFFD -> FCCECDCD
2. Apply rule 4, "CD"->"DB": FCCECDCD -> FCCECDBD
3. Apply rule 2, "EC"->"FF": FCCECDBD -> FCFFDBDB
4. Apply rule 3, "CFFD"->"DD": FCFFDBDB (No direct application). Check steps made from start
Lets try using initial string. FCFFD -> rule #3 not applicable. There isnt' substring in INITIAL_STRING. However, CFFD. No application

Let backtrack on the initial plan as now to

Applying Step 5 will requires final stage ->FDBBDD , Now
