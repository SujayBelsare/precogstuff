Let's analyze the initial string "DEFEBB" and the available transitions to derive a sequence that leads to an empty string.

Initial String: "DEFEBB"

Available transitions:
1) "EF"->"FF"
2) "B"->"AB"
3) "F"->"FC"
4) "DFCFEEAABB"->""

1. Apply rule 1 "EF"->"FF" to the initial string:
DEFEBB -> DFFEBB

2. Apply rule 3 "F"->"FC" to the modified string:
DFFEBB -> DFCFEBB

3. Apply rule 2 "B"->"AB" to the modified string twice:
DFCFEBB -> DFCFEABB -> DFCFEAABB

4. Apply rule 4 "DFCFEEAABB"->"": This rule is similar, so let's modify the existing rule to fit what we want it to fit and go back. If there is still something after modifying the existing rule.
Since there are only 4 transitions, the optimal route should contain only the given transition or their derivation only.
However, it is extremely hard to obtain an exact sequence using the approach. Thus it could be derived backwards.

Target: ""
Rule 4. DFCFEEAABB
In order to obtain DFCFEEAABB, since 4 uses "" directly, we need to reach to DFCFEEAABB directly and 2 is "B" -> "AB", thus to approach, the first step would be
DFFEBB by turning EF to FF with rule 1.

Let's review from "DEFEBB".
DEFEBB.

Rule 1: EF -> FF. Then DFFEBB
Rule 2: B -> AB. The result must go with other rules than rule 2. Since other than AB it would turn longer. Rule 3 requires F->FC, let's see
Rule 3: F -> FC. Then DEFCFCBB - Not ideal.
Let's keep pursuing the "DFFEBB" line
If "B" -> "AB", we can modify. DFFEAABB - rule 4 requires DFCF.. and rule 1/2/3 requires DFF...

If we have DEFEEB -> DEFFFCFC..., then this line won't yield result, it is expanding.

Another test:
Start: DEFEBB
"EF"->"FF"  => DFFEBB
"F"->"FC" => DFCFEBB
"B"->"AB" twice => DFCFEAABB.
DFCFEAABB, let's review rule 4.

We need rule 4. So "DFCFEEAABB"

Since we're at DFCFEAABB. In that regard, EF must become EE. Rule 1: "EF"->"FF" so cannot make it to become EF->EE.

Initial string: "DEFEBB"
1. Transition 1: EF -> FF; so DFFEBB.
2. Transition 2: B -> AB; so DFFEAABB.
Stuck. Cannot move.
Initial string: "DEFEBB"

D *EF* -> FF (rule 1)
DEFEBB -> DFFEBB
DFC *FEAABB ->""
cannot transit.

Initial string: "DEFEBB"

Transition 2 "B"->"AB".

DEFEAB
Impossible. There is a deadlock here

Let's assume "DFCFEEAABB" -> "" can be generalized into other derivations
What if our Goal is "EE" = FF? -> E = F, cannot work. Thus rule four must match the letters

Here's the sequence.

DEFEBB -> DFFEBB (Rule 1)
DFFEBB -> DFCFEBB (Rule 3)
DFCFEBB -> DFCFEABB (Rule 2)
DFCFEABB -> DFCFEEAABB (Error on prior application of rule 2, this should instead be "DFCFEAABB"->"DFCFEEAABB" where it is implied from B becoming E and A becoming A. This won't happen)

DFCFEEAABB -> "" - so impossible to convert DFCFEABB using B-AB into what is wanted from here.

[1, 3, 2, 2] is a dead end route

```
Initial String: "DEFEBB"
```

1. **B -> AB**: `DEFEBB -> DEFEAB`
2. **F -> FC**: `DEFEAB -> DEFECAB`
There's not really much. Let us test with the second F from `Initial string "DEFEBB"`, it is obvious there's NO right approach to make the solution using current given rules only.
The problem doesn't use any general way to shorten at the back so rule 4 should exist, where all characters could be cancelled directly or shortened a bit with rules before applying.
With the analysis, **it is unsolvable by logic**.

FINAL ANSWER: There is no mathematically proven way to arrive at "". Therefore, there is no solution under these constraints.
