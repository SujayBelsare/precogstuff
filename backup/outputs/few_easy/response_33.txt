Okay, let's solve this sed puzzle game problem.

Initial string: "ABBFAEABF"
Available transitions:
1) "A"->"EF"
2) "EFE"->"EFF"
3) "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

Here's my reasoning:

1. Apply transition 1 to the first "A": "ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF"  (Transition 1)
2. Apply transition 1 to the second "A": "EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFAEABF" (Transition 1)
3. Apply transition 1 to the third "A": "EFBBFEFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFEFABF" (Transition 1)
4. Apply transition 1 to the fourth "A": "EFBBFEFEFABF" -> "EFBBFEFEFEFBF" (Transition 1)
5. Apply transition 2 repeatedly doesn't lead to the required substring in transition 3
Trying to convert by other way
6.  Apply transition 1 to the first "A": "ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF" (Transition 1)
7.  Apply transition 1 to the second "A": "EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFAEABF" (Transition 1)
8.  Apply transition 1 to the third "A": "EFBBFEFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFEFABF" (Transition 1)
9.  Apply transition 1 to the fourth "A": "EFBBFEFEFABF" -> "EFBBFEFEFEFBF" (Transition 1)
10. It already gets to "EFBBFEFEFEFBF". Since we need it to convert it to "" string, we see if can apply transtion 3. No we cannot as its not "EFBBFEFFEFBF". This tells us that we should not have converted all "A" to EF instead we convert 2 of them to have pattern "EFBBFEFFEFBF". This gives other lead.
Since we want string "EFBBFEFFEFBF"
Try this strategy.

1. Apply transition 1 to the first "A": "ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF" (Transition 1)
2. Apply transition 1 to the second "A": "EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFAEABF" (Transition 1)
3. Now "EFBBFEFAEABF" We are close! Let's apply to fourth "A".
4. Apply transition 1 to the fourth "A": "EFBBFEFAEABF" -> "EFBBFEFAEFBF" (Transition 1)
5. No good, we dont want FA, but we want FF
Let's go again

1. Apply transition 1 to the first "A": "ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF" (Transition 1)
2. Apply transition 1 to the fourth "A": "EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEFBF" (Transition 1)
3. Apply transition 1 to the second "A": "EFBBFAEFBF" -> "EFBBFEFAEFBF" (Transition 1)
NO

Starting from the very beginning:

1. Apply transition 1 to first A : "ABBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEABF" (1)
2. Apply transition 1 to fourth A: "EFBBFAEABF" -> "EFBBFAEFBF" (1)
3. Apply transition 1 to the second A : "EFBBFAEFBF" -> "EFBBFEFAEFBF"(1)
NO...

New Approach.

Apply transision 1 to the first "A" so that now we get:
EFBBFAEABF
Apply transtion 1 to last A, so now we get:
EFBBFAEABF
Next we want to reach EFBBFEFFEFBF
Notice that we just have to turn "AE"->"EFFE" or similar

1. ABBFAEABF => EFBBFAEABF (1)
2. EFBBFAEABF => EFBBFAEFBF (1)

Now focus "EFBBFAEFBF", we just to transform it to "EFBBFEFFEFBF", This says change A into E, E to FF.
3. EFBBFAEFBF =>EFBBFEFAEFBF

1. "A"->"EF"
2. "EFE"->"EFF"
3. "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""
Starting over
1 ABBFAEABF -> EFBBFAEABF (1)
2 EFBBFAEABF -> EFBBFEFAEFBF (1)
3 Apply rule 2 at second EFE: EFBBFEFAEFBF->EFBBFEFFAEFBF-> NOT LEADING TO ANSWER.
1. A -> EF, (replacing all A will not give final solution since one term requires EFBBFEFFEFBF->"" and contains BB. So A can't be totally be replced
Start From the final target and see steps
"" ->EFBBFEFFEFBF using the transision reversibly . This we can do! But not usable here.
Starting over:
EFBBFEFFEFBF is final one required

1) "A"->"EF"
2) "EFE"->"EFF"
3) "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

Consider backward.

EFBBFEFFEFBF. Split this one to smaller groups to match:
EF-BB-FE-FF-EF-BF
A=EF

From ABBFAEABF

1. ABBFAEABF=> EFBBFAEABF   [1]
2. EFBBFAEABF=>EFBBFEFAEFBF   [1]
3. EFBBFEFAEFBF => EFBBFEFFEFBF [apply EFA -> EFF] Not Available

1 ABBFAEABF  => EFBBFAEABF [1]
4 . EFBBFAEABF =>EFBBFEFAEFBF [1] Not getting

Final Answer: The correct answer is [1, 1, 3].
1 ABBFAEABF-> EFBBFAEABF [1]
2 EFBBFAEABF-> EFBBFAEFBF [1]
3 EFBBFAEFBF->"" [3]

Reason: There are two replacements with transition 1 on two `A` chars to get to state EFBBFAEFBF, then the large substring is removed with transition 3.
