Okay, let's tackle this Sed Puzzle Game problem. We want to convert "BCCBDDEC" to "".
Available transitions:
1) "DD"->"EF"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"->""

Initial string: "BCCBDDEC"

Let's analyze possible starting moves and think backward from the target of "". Since only rule 3 allows us to reach an empty string. The target must be transformed into DCDCDCBCCBEFEC somehow.

Let's start with applying rule 1.
BCCBDDEC -> BCCBEFEC

Current String: BCCBEFEC.  This looks promising as BCC and FEC appears in Rule 3. Rule 3 requires DCDCDC at the start however.

Let's insert "" with rule 2 a few times and then apply rule 1:

BCCBDDEC
BCCBDDEC -> BCCBDDE"DC"C --doesn't make progress
BCCBDDEC -> BCCBDDE"DC"C --this does not seem helpful.

Let's backtrack and approach the problem differently.
The desired final string for rule 3 is: DCDCDCBCCBEFEC

BCCBDDEC needs to become DCDCDCBCCBEFEC. This will involve addition of "DC". Since adding "DC" does nothing. let's rethink this:
Let's try a series of rule 1 to alter string:
BCCBDDEC -> BCCBEFEC - useful.
Try to manipulate rest:
Consider target "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".
"BCCBEFEC". We already have "BCCBEFEC", which exists at the end. Let's try add "DCDCDC" to the start of the string before BCCBEFEC somehow

Let's test if we go backwards from the rule 3, is it easier
Rule 3: "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"->""
Since adding "" is a valid action, inserting "" after DD does change string. But does it make string closer to DCDCDCBCCBEFEC string.
What if we added "DC" after "DD" -> BCCBDD"DC"EC

"BCCBDDEC" has "BCC" which could be useful at position DCDCDCBCCBEFEC. But can we reach it. Not sure

However, if our aim to is achieve "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC". If we add in using rule 2 a few times: we are likely to have 5 uses for rule 2: This sounds ridiculous, so we reject the approach.

Instead, let's simplify by transforming this by using rule 1 repeatedly
BCCBDDEC -> BCCBEFEC -- Apply rule 1: DD -> EF. String now contains the later characters "BCCBEFEC". This looks encouraging for reaching the longer sequence "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC",

However let us think: the string after the action only gets smaller or constant size. So adding any using "" adds to string which does not help.

BCCBDDEC can transform to the last 8 elements which means "DCDCDC" can form

Final solution :Impossible. I did it the wrong way from the goal to starting
What needs to happen
DCDCDCBCCBEFEC is obtained, if so transition 3 triggers, and the goal of empty string happens

BCCBDDEC
Apply Rule 1 --> BCCBEFEC.

Then we would need somehow "DCDCDC" which we need 3 D's alternating with Cs followed.

Let's reverse from Rule 3's precondition

Given the rule requirements
(BCCBDDEC ) cannot become (DCDCDCBCCBEFEC).
Why: You have addition with "". The only option seems to add DCs every available point until "DCDCDC" emerges .

I think it's mathematically unsound the statement that says "It is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable". Rule 2 can inject in to any available space
But still it looks unsolvable, the insertion creates a chaos

However this cannot make 2 strings equal and the set rules will reduce, this rule looks unsolvable
