Okay, let's analyze the given problem:

Available transitions:
1) "BB"->"EB"
2) "EBAC"->"CCDB"
3) "ADAECCDEBFAA"->""

Initial string: "ADABBBACBFAA"

We want to reach an empty string using the available transitions. Let's try to apply transitions in a strategic manner.

1. **ADABBBACBFAA** -> Using rule 1: "BB"->"EB"  -> **ADAEBACBFAA**
2. **ADAEBACBFAA** -> Using rule 2: "EBAC"->"CCDB" -> **ADACCDBFAA**

Now the string is "ADACCDBFAA". Let's focus on making it closer to transition rule 3:  "ADAECCDEBFAA". We need "AECCDEBFAA" after the initial "AD".

* Currently: "ADACCDBFAA"

Let's analyze the differences between the target "ADAECCDEBFAA" and the current "ADACCDBFAA".
We have "ACCDB" instead of "AECCDEB".

Let's see what we can do with the transitions. Notice transition 1, BB->EB is unhelpful, and transition 3 instantly solves it.
Transition 2 (EBAC->CCDB) doesn't help towards forming transition 3.
Trying some manipulations.

If we go back and instead convert to ADACCDBFAA, how would we then turn that into the "ADAECCDEBFAA" for transition 3?

Let's look for ways to get "AE" early on.
We have "ADABBBACBFAA". We know BB can convert to EB, we want to have "ADAE" in the string.
1. **ADABBBACBFAA** -> Using rule 1: "BB"->"EB"  -> **ADAEBACBFAA**
2. **ADAEBACBFAA** -> Using rule 2: "EBAC"->"CCDB" -> **ADACCDBFAA** This does not work.

3. Consider:
1. **ADABBBACBFAA** -> Applying rule 1: "BB"->"EB" -> **ADAEBACBFAA** 

How can we construct  "ADAECCDEBFAA" next?
Currently we have "ADAEBACBFAA" We want this pattern:"AECCDEBFAA"

4. **ADABBBACBFAA** -> 1 -> **ADAEBACBFAA**
Hmm EBAC in "ADAEBACBFAA" becomes  "CCDB" which isn't ideal, we seek  E,C,C,D,E,B,FAA
5. From here, it's likely the optimal action is to not act. Consider something which is more similar in format with the goal ADACCDBFAA -> need more letters, or we are wasting an action when all the letters appear to be able to be shortened by one. Is it a red herring?

So the initial approach was more correct
"ADABBBACBFAA" We want to reach "ADAECCDEBFAA" through operations. Lets try creating the left and working right

Let us analyze:
ADABBBACBFAA --> "BB"->"EB"
ADAEBACBFAA --> "EBAC" -> "CCDB"
ADACCDBFAA is where we want the AECCDEBFAA to appear.
Lets manipulate what BB does

ADABBBACBFAA : "BB" to "EB", that changes into
ADAEBACBFAA

"EBAC"->"CCDB" so we need to avoid creating that transition until later
So lets consider

ADABBBACBFAA-> AD(EB)BBACBFAA(Not Possible)

I think there has to be BB and EB or other patterns hidden we arent' currently viewing to shorten
consider AD AEB FAA. AFA is not useful. Consider BBB ACB FAA --? EBE

lets redo this. start clean
initial string "ADABBBACBFAA" -->goal: ""

1) **ADABBBACBFAA** -> rule 1 ("BB"->"EB")-> **ADAEBACBFAA**
2) **ADAEBACBFAA** -> rule 2 ("EBAC"->"CCDB")-> **ADACCDBFAA**
We now need AECCDEBFAA but current = ACCDB

3) rule 3 works with ADAECCDEBFAA
So

BB=EB
EBAC-> CCDB
What other order might make sense?

We need to have this EXACT string available to clear.
ADABBBACBFAA -> ? -> ADAECCDEBFAA 
**ADABBBACBFAA** Apply Rule 1 gives **ADAEBACBFAA** We cannot turn back
Next stage
**ADAEBACBFAA**: we use this to be "CCDBFAA"
Cannot be reverse
Then how to change the string from **CCDBFAA --> AECCDEBFAA

Lets go backward
Transition #3 : ADAECCDEBFAA  --> we are to produce this string with transitions 1,2. If we reverse transitions we'll go from there
So

Transition #3: ADAECCDEBFAA --> ""
Therefore: list becomes = [3]
initial= **ADABBBACBFAA**.
Thus, that means from this state to reach our string
Lets check each:
ADABBBACBFAA becomes ADAECCDEBFAA
Thus: rule 3.
**[3]**
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[3]}$
