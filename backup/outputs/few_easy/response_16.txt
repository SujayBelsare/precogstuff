Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully and derive the correct sequence of transitions to convert the initial string "BCECE" to an empty string.

Available transitions:
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

Initial string: "BCECE"

1. **BCECE**: We can apply transition 1 since "ECE" is present.
2. Applying transition 1,  "ECE"->"EA", the string becomes: **BEA**.  So, transition [1]
3. We can apply transition 2, ""->"BB" since we want to insert "BB" into the string **BEA**. It would be useless to simply add BB to the start of the current string.
4. Let us try to find another way to get "BBBBBBBCEA".
"BCECE" -> "BEA" -> (no match)

The problem is we have "EA" but we have no rule to get rid of EA except rule 3 which is "BBBBBBBCEA". Let's rethink how to approach this.

We need "BBBBBBBCEA" to appear, so we must create "CEA" and a series of 7 "B"s before it.
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

Let's try inserting many ""->"BB" into the string.
1. "BCECE" remains untouched.
2. Apply ""->"BB". What happens?
   BCECE becomes BBCBCECE.
3. Apply 1, so, BBCBCECE -> BBCBEA. We can get closer.
Let us insert as many as we need to get to 7 "B"s
1.  BCECE -- [2] --> BBCECE
2.  BBCECE -- [2] --> BBBBCECE
3.  BBBBCECE -- [2] --> BBBBBCECE
4.  BBBBCECE -- [2] --> BBBBBBCECE
5.  BBBBBBCECE -- [2] --> BBBBBBBCECE
6. BBBBBBBCECE -- [1] --> BBBBBBBCEA. Finally we have the string.
7. BBBBBBBCEA -- [3] --> "".

So we used 5 inserts via transition [2] followed by transition [1], then transition [3]. This brings us to the empty string.

Solution: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]
