Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial String: "4E387CC50"

Available transitions:
1) "C50"->"AF"
2) "4"->"4B"
3) "4B"->"B6"
4) "E3"->"3D76C679F"
5) "CAF"->"16"
6) "87"->"691"
7) "B63D76C679F69116"->""

Here's the thought process to find the correct series of transitions:

1. **Target Identification:** The ultimate goal is to reach "B63D76C679F69116" and eliminate it with rule 7. We need to find a sequence of steps to introduce this exact string as a substring.

2. **Early Transformations:** Notice the initial string starts with "4E3". We also see transformation rule 4 which starts with "E3". Let's try applying rules on the beginning of the string:
    - Apply Rule 2 to the leading '4': "4E387CC50" -> "4BE387CC50"
    - Apply Rule 3 to "4B": "4BE387CC50" -> "B6E387CC50"
    - Apply Rule 4 to "E3": "B6E387CC50" -> "B63D76C679F87CC50"
    - Apply Rule 6 to "87": "B63D76C679F87CC50" -> "B63D76C679F691CC50"

3. **Create 'CAF' with "C50":**
   - Apply Rule 1 to "C50": "B63D76C679F691CC50" -> "B63D76C679F691CAF"

4. **Transformation 'CAF'**:
    - Apply Rule 5: "B63D76C679F691CAF" -> "B63D76C679F69116"

5. **Final Transition:** The string is now identical to the left-hand side of rule 7:
    - Apply Rule 7: "B63D76C679F69116" -> ""

**Final Answer:**
[2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7]
