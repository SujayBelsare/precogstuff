Okay, let's analyze the problem meticulously. The goal is to transform "8BB86503B248" into "".

Available transitions:
1) "8"->"81"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"

The only transition that directly leads to the empty string is transition 3, but it requires "DC811111BB86503B248". Our initial string is "8BB86503B248". Therefore, we need to apply the other rules in such a way that allows us to reach this state. The other available transitions allow us to modify this state, so we must choose our applications of these transitions judiciously to form the required state.

We can use rule 1 ("8"->"81") and rule 2 (""->"DC"). It's very important to not get the wrong amount of ones after the 8 since there are many in rule 3. Since transition 3 removes the entire string 'DC811111BB86503B248', it is worth noting the location and amount of characters until this part in the final answer. Specifically 'DC' precedes '811111'.

Current: "8BB86503B248"

1) Apply rule 1: "8BB86503B248" -> "81BB86503B248"
Now, how do we obtain "DC" at the beginning and enough "1"s between that and the B? Also note the final transition removes all characters at once if it equals the specified string. The rule to use to obtain "DC" is:

2) Apply rule 2: "81BB86503B248" -> "DC81BB86503B248".

So "DC" and "81" of the desired final form is taken care of. Now, let's strategically add ones so it is "DC811111BB86503B248".

3) Apply rule 1 four times in a row. Note that if the first number is the first instance of an 8 in the string, this rule will only replace the first instance. After this operation happens four times in total, the state will be as follows:

Apply rule 1: "DC81BB86503B248" -> "DC811BB86503B248"
Apply rule 1: "DC811BB86503B248" -> "DC8111BB86503B248"
Apply rule 1: "DC8111BB86503B248" -> "DC81111BB86503B248"
Apply rule 1: "DC81111BB86503B248" -> "DC811111BB86503B248"

So finally, to get to an empty string from the current state, the only way we know of is by using rule 3:
4) Apply rule 3: "DC811111BB86503B248" -> ""

So our steps should be as follows: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]
