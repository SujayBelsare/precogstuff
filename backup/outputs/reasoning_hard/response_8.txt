Okay, let's break down this Sed Puzzle Game problem step by step. The initial string is "B7FCD61" and we want to reach an empty string using the provided transitions.

**Available transitions:**

1.  "61" -> "08"
2.  "" -> "94"
3.  "9494" -> "18FA73"
4.  "9418FA7394B7FCD08" -> ""

**Initial string:** "B7FCD61"

Let's analyze the target, transition 4. We want our string to resemble "9418FA7394B7FCD08". Note that "B7FCD" is in our initial string "B7FCD61". It appears that the goal is to somehow create the pattern from Rule 4. Also, let us try to make the string closer to the start of Rule 4 by transforming `61` into `08`, creating a pattern present in the start.
B7FCD61 -> B7FCD08 (Applying rule 1)

Now we see that `B7FCD08` is the ending section of Rule 4. The goal now will be to find a way to reach Rule 4 using the available transitions. It appears that rule 2 will allow us to append "94". However, applying this rule once will make us further from reaching rule 4. We notice the pattern 94 appears twice at the start of Rule 4. Thus we apply rule 2 twice:
B7FCD08 -> 94B7FCD08 (Applying Rule 2)
94B7FCD08 -> 9494B7FCD08 (Applying Rule 2)

Now the prefix is "9494", which appears in rule 3. After this transition we can apply transition rule 4 and successfully end up with an empty string.
9494B7FCD08 -> 18FA73B7FCD08 (Applying rule 3)
18FA73B7FCD08 -> 9418FA73B7FCD08 (Applying Rule 2)
9418FA73B7FCD08 -> 9418FA7394B7FCD08 (Applying Rule 2)
9418FA7394B7FCD08 -> "" (Applying Rule 4)

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4]}$
