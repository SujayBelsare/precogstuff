Okay, let's analyze the initial string "6B128" and the available transitions to derive the solution. We must reach an empty string using only the provided rules.

Available transitions:
1) "1"->"C6"
2) "2"->"59"
3) ""->"4F"
4) "4F6BC6BBB598"->""

Initial string: "6B128"

1.  "6B128"

The only immediately applicable transformation is replacing '1' with "C6" (Rule 1), or replacing '2' with '59'(Rule 2)

If we do rule 1:
"6B128" -> "6BC628"

If we do rule 2:
"6B128" -> "6B1598"

Let's pursue the option of transforming '2' using Rule 2 "2"->"59":

2. "6B128" -> "6B1598"
Now let's introduce the "4F" that is needed for rule 4, by inserting "4F" using rule 3 at the start

3. "6B1598" -> "4F6B1598"

Transform '1' to 'C6' to setup the necessary format for rule 4:
4. "4F6B1598" -> "4F6BC6598"

Now apply the transition for '59', which needs a preceding 'B': It might be optimal to have more 'B'
Consider repeating transforming the starting String to trigger all transformations and eventually the final condition.
Trying to go backwards will be difficult.
Applying Rule 1 again transforms another part of the string to prepare for the final state.
This expansion strategy appears best.

Consider trying this solution instead:

1. "6B128" -> "6BC628" // Rule 1, replacing "1" with "C6"

Apply rule 2

2.  "6BC628" -> "6BC6598"

We need 4F to begin. Introduce it using Rule 3.
3. "6BC6598" -> "4F6BC6598"

The string "4F6BC6BBB598" is nearly in our string.
"4F6BC6598"

We can replace "2"->"59", by Rule 2 after it.

Okay so the solution is simply adding a 4F to the start which might be done with this
1) "1"->"C6"
2) "2"->"59"
3) ""->"4F"
4) "4F6BC6BBB598"->""

Start
"6B128"

Rule 1
"6BC628"

Rule 2

"6BC6598"

Now inject 'BBB', this is hard as we do not have such insertion transitions

It appears there is no solution as there is no way to convert "6BC6598" to "4F6BC6BBB598", or any close substring since "4F6BC6BBB598" is an atomic transition.

Since ""->"4F" , the goal is to create the 6BC6BBB598 section after that, which seems impossible given rules one and two replace 1 with "C6" and 2 with "59" respectively
Then we are locked.

"6B128"

If we begin with ""->"4F" directly.
"4F6B128", is useless since it does not start "4F6BC6BBB598".

FINAL ANSWER:
There exists no sequence of application. Since neither using rule 1, rule 2, nor rule 3 will result in an opportunity to form rule 4.

TERMINATE.
