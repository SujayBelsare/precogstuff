Okay, let's analyze the given problem.

Initial string: "4E592"
Available transitions:
1) "4E"->"0F"
2) "2"->"8D"
3) "5"->"B2"
4) "98D"->"E8"
5) "DE"->"F0"
6) "0FB8F08"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 "4E"->"0F"
"4E592" -> "0F592"
Sequence: [1]

Step 2: Apply transition 3 "5"->"B2"
"0F592" -> "0FB292"
Sequence: [1, 3]

Step 3: Apply transition 2 "2"->"8D"
"0FB292" -> "0FB8D92"
Sequence: [1, 3, 2]

Step 4: Apply transition 2 "2"->"8D"
"0FB8D92" -> "0FB8D98D"
Sequence: [1, 3, 2, 2]

Step 5: Apply transition 4 "98D"->"E8"
"0FB8D98D" -> "0FB8DE8"
Sequence: [1, 3, 2, 2, 4]

Step 6: Apply transition 5 "DE"->"F0"
"0FB8DE8" -> "0FB8F08"
Sequence: [1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5]

Step 7: Apply transition 6 "0FB8F08"->""
"0FB8F08" -> ""
Sequence: [1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6]

Therefore, the final solution is:
[1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6]
