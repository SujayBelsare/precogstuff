Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem step-by-step.

Initial string: "A568648"

1. **Apply transition 2: "A56"->"84D"**
   A568648 -> 84D8648
   Transitions so far: [2]

2. **Apply transition 3: "84D"->"E7"**
   84D8648 -> E78648
   Transitions so far: [2, 3]

3. **Apply transition 1: "48"->"F7"** (to the remaining 48). Note: no immediate earlier transitions work right now. We must proceed by consuming the original string.
   E78648 -> E786F7
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1]

4. Let's apply a transition on the first occurence of what is available. It appears applying transition 6 is the only available one at this time.
    **Apply transition 6: "F"->"F2"**
    E786F7 -> E786F27
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1, 6]

5. To get transition 7 to work, we must make sure that `86` can be simplified into a zero. This would involve first converting the 8 to 8F4783 and getting it turned into `B0E2`. Currently it would be better to focus on the "E7" that the string now begins with. This would mean trying transition 4 to see if the puzzle will let us consume from left to right at a more effective rate.
    **Apply transition 4: "E786F"->"F8F4783"**
    E786F27 -> F8F478327
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1, 6, 4]

6. It looks like applying transition 5 is a great option from the current starting point:
    **Apply transition 5: "8F4783"->"B0E2"**
    F8F478327 -> FB0E227
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 5]

7. This leads to there being an F at the beginning of the line. This means we will make use of transition 6.
    **Apply transition 6: "F"->"F2"**
    FB0E227 -> F2B0E227
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 5, 6]

8. At this stage we can apply a variation of what is available to arrive at the final string. From inspection, we see that there is an almost applicable transition.
    **Apply transition 7: "F2B0E27"->""**
     F2B0E227-> <Error; there is not string to perform matching to. We must revert a step>
    Since applying transition 6 twice will make there be a collision that does not result in a string that will become an empty string, it may make sense to consider starting from when E7 was made and exploring that variation.
    Therefore we must first delete 6 and 7, but keep the memory of how it looked.

5(ALT). Let's apply a transition on the first occurence of what is available. It appears applying transition 6 is the only available one at this time.
    **Apply transition 6: "F"->"F2"**
    E786F7 -> E786F27
    Transitions so far: [2, 3, 1]

6. Let us revert to looking at transition 1. The second step is applying this rule to transition 48. We can use 48 -> F7 to obtain F8F4783... Let us revisit a state. 

Final Solution:

**Apply transition 1: "48"->"F7"**
A568648 -> A5686F7
[1]

**Apply transition 2: "A56"->"84D"**
A5686F7 -> 84D86F7
[1, 2]

**Apply transition 3: "84D"->"E7"**
84D86F7 -> E786F7
[1, 2, 3]

**Apply transition 4: "E786F"->"F8F4783"**
E786F7 -> F8F47837
[1, 2, 3, 4]

**Apply transition 5: "8F4783"->"B0E2"**
F8F47837 -> FB0E27
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Apply transition 6: "F"->"F2"**
FB0E27 -> F2B0E27
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

**Apply transition 7: "F2B0E27"->""**
F2B0E27 -> ""
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
