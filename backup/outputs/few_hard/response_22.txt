Okay, let's analyze the problem and find a valid sequence of transitions to convert "40BB9DC" to "".

Initial string: "40BB9DC"

Available transitions:
1) "40B"->"A5A"
2) "A5AB"->"4710E"
3) "4710E9DC"->"62D6576"
4) "D6"->"C2"
5) "62C25"->"30"
6) "0"->"83"
7) "38376"->""

1. Apply transition 1 to "40B":
"40BB9DC" -> "A5AB9DC"
[1]

2. Apply transition 2 to "A5AB":
"A5AB9DC" -> "4710E9DC"
[1, 2]

3. Apply transition 3 to "4710E9DC":
"4710E9DC" -> "62D6576"
[1, 2, 3]

4. Apply transition 4 to "D6":
"62D6576" -> "62C2576"
[1, 2, 3, 4]

5. Apply transition 5 to "62C25":
"62C2576" -> "3076"
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

6. Apply transition 6 to "0":
"3076" -> "38376"
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

7. Apply transition 7 to "38376":
"38376" -> ""
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Solution:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
