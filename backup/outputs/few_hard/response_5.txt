Okay, let's analyze the given problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to reduce the initial string "6B128" to an empty string.

Initial string: "6B128"

Available transitions:
1) "1"->"C6"
2) "2"->"59"
3) ""->"4F"
4) "4F6BC6BBB598"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "6B128". This replaces the first occurrence of "1" with "C6".
"6B128" -> "6BC628"
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "6BC628". This replaces the first occurrence of "2" with "59".
"6BC628" -> "6BC6598"
[1, 2]

Step 3: Analyze the current string "6BC6598". Now let's consider insertion via the 3rd rule:  ""->"4F", let's not add "4F" to a spot that could prevent rule 4 being applicable.

Step 4: Apply transition 1 to insert "C6":
Insert "C6" after the "B". It is no applicable, so, ignore.

The end goal is 4F6BC6BBB598. So lets apply transition 1 two times more
Step 5: Apply transition 3: Insert "4F" after the 6:
"6BC6598" is not empty now.
Apply 1 is useless. Let's look at another approach.
"6B128"->"6BC628"
"6BC628"->"6BC6598"
We want the string  "4F6BC6BBB598"

Instead lets try this route.

Step 1: apply transition 1: "6B128"->"6BC628"
[1]

Step 2: apply transition 1 again, at the empty "" "6BC628"->"6BC62C68". That will not help
[1, 1]

Step 3: Consider using Rule number two from our last stage of "6BC6598"
"6BC628"->"6BC6598"

Now how to introduce our two missing Bs? Transition number 1 is our best bet but we do not have "1".

Step 1: "6B128" -> "6BC628" (Rule 1)
[1]

Step 2: "6BC628" -> "6BC6598" (Rule 2)
[1, 2]

Step 3: Apply "4F". 
Still will not solve since all three rules 1, 2, 3. Can only modify 1 position or insert one.

Another thought.
We must somehow obtain "4F6BC6BBB598".
Start: "6B128"

If we want the "4F" we need to get an empty string first.

Stuck. let's look for the string 4F6BC6BBB598 from our initial. 6B , We also have 598. We have C6. WE are missing "4F", "BBB".

"6B128"

1->"C6"
2->"59"
""->"4F"
"4F6BC6BBB598"->""

This is hard. The transitions are not obvious. We need to see if there is some tricks. We must introduce three Bs. 
"6B128" -> "6BC628" -1
"6BC628" -> "6BC6598"-2

"6BC6598"
We want "4F6BC6BBB598" ->""

If there are only those operations. and the goal is to be converted into an empty string.
Transition 4 will only get the final result when there is "4F6BC6BBB598" on the stack

Impossible! Because transition one converts '1' to 'C6' transition 2 converts '2' to '59'. transition 3 converts nothing to '4F', and finally transition converts '4F6BC6BBB598' to "".
"6B128"->"6BC628"->"6BC6598", this is it? where are three Bs in the middle? is this solvable?
Is there an error on the question??

Okay I see how this goes...

It involves inserting "4F" using rule 3 at the beginning. Then using the other rules such that we can remove.
Rule 1 is also not working for adding extra "B" but "C6". So where these BBB's would comes from?!
Okay, i give up, there must be error on questions... I have tested every single routes....

FINAL ANSWER: IMPOSSIBLE. There is likely an error on the given available transitions, it cannot result the removal of the provided initial conditions as "4F6BC6BBB598" by transitions 1,2,3. Also, the transformation of original value to empty strings based on all the stated rules in this turn is against all the mathematical proofs which must not be correct for a feasible route to become ""
