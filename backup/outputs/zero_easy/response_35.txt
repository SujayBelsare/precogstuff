Okay, I understand. Let's begin the Sed Puzzle Game. My goal is to transform the initial string "FABFF" into an empty string "" using the given transitions, applied in order. I must be precise.

Initial String: "FABFF"

1. **Apply transition 1 to the first "F":**  "FABFF" -> "EEABFF"
2. **Apply transition 1 to the first "F":**  "EEABFF" -> "EEABEEF"
3. **Apply transition 1 to the first "F":** "EEABEEF" -> "EEABEEEE"
4. **Apply transition 2:**  "EEABEEEE" -> "ACEEABEEEE"
5. **Apply transition 3:** "ACEEABEEEE" -> ""

Solution: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}$
