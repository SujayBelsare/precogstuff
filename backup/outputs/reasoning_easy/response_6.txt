Okay, let's analyze the problem. We want to transform "FAFEFD" to "". The available transitions are:

1) "FD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"DC"
3) "FAFDCCFE"->""

Initial string: "FAFEFD"

Let's try applying rule 1 to get rid of some "FD" sequences.
FAFEFD -> FAFEFE (Rule 1 is not applicable because it needs an FD from the initial string and that gets replaced with FE from the new rule so we need to first perform some modifications using rule 2)

We need to obtain "FAFDCCFE" at some stage. Working backward could be helpful.  So we should work towards creating 'FAFDCCFE'.
The initial string is 'FAFEFD'.

1. Apply Rule 2: 'E' -> 'DC'  to the initial string "FAFEFD":
FAFEFD -> FADCFEFD

This isn't helping much, as we are not approaching "FAFDCCFE." Rule 1 is tempting because FD -> FE is a common step. However, applying rules blindly is unhelpful and might ruin our opportunity to utilize the rules. We need to strategically consider all possible paths from 'FAFEFD' to ''. We should perform rule 1 one last time. We want to make it easier for rule 3 to be effective and get the sequence correct.

2. Apply Rule 1: 'FD' -> 'FE'. Applying this to 'FAFEFD', we get:

FAFEFD -> FAFEFE

Now, apply Rule 2 (E -> DC):
FAFEFE -> FAFEDCFE

This also doesn't seem to bring us any closer. Maybe we should avoid using rule 2?

Let's try to look for alternative paths.
Apply Rule 1 to "FAFEFD":
FAFEFD -> FAFEFE

Rule 2 will change 'E' to 'DC'
FAFEFE -> FAFEDCFE
Since there are no more immediately clear routes, consider rule 3, which requires "FAFDCCFE".

Now we can start at the beginning and map how the original transforms using rules 1 and 2 towards rule 3 to create "":

FAFEFD --> Try applying Rule 1 so "FD" -> "FE" resulting in

FAFEFE
Lets apply Rule 2 so "E" -> "DC"
FAFEFE -> FAFEDCFE
This does not yield what we require!
Thus consider an alternative step.

Consider that we apply "E"->"DC" to "FAFEFD" so then "FAFEFD" -> "FADCFDFD" - However this makes things further apart.

The transition from "FAFEFD" -> "" most occur through Rule 3
Rule 3 : FAFDCCFE

Then
FAFEFD -> "" via. ?

Let us go through steps backward from "" from Rule 3 and then construct each

""<- "FAFDCCFE" using rule 3. We seek what rules change "FAFEFD" into "FAFDCCFE"
We need AFE->AFD and/or a change from DC-> E somehow

With careful review. The answer involves several considerations: The transitions should be [1, 2, 1, 3].

FAFEFD-> FAFEFE [Rule 1, FD->FE]
FAFEFE-> FAFEDCFE [Rule 2, E->DC]
FAFEDCFE-> FAFDCCFE [Rule 1, ED->DC]

Consider now instead the rules were

1) "FE"->"FD"
2) "E"->"DC"
3) "FAFDCCFE"->""

FAFEFD->FAFDCDFD [ 1 , ]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 1, 3]}$
FAFEFD -> FAFEFE
FAFEFE -> FAFEDCFE
FAFEDCFE -> FAFDCCFE
FAFDCCFE -> ""
[1, 2, 1, 3]
