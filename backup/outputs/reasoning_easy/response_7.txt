Okay, let's analyze the given problem meticulously.

Available transitions:
1) "DD"->"EF"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"->""

Initial string: "BCCBDDEC"

Goal: Convert "BCCBDDEC" to "".

Let's try to work backwards from the final state "".  The only rule that can result in this is rule 3.
Thus, we need to get to "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".  Looking at the initial string, we have some common characters. The goal is to transform BCCBDDEC to DCDCDCBCCBEFEC. Let us compare them char by char and see if we can identify any strategy for applying the transformations:
BCCBDDEC
DCDCDCBCCBEFEC

- B to D
- C to C
- C to D
- B to C
- D to D
- D to C
- E to B
- C to E

Applying Rule 2 once adds "DC" to an empty string, meaning we must *not* consider this path to solving this problem.

We can only get rid of substrings using rule 3. Rule 1 replaces "DD" with "EF" which doesn't seem helpful right now.

The only way for this transformation to be possible would involve a sequence of operations that rearranges the characters to have "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC". Let's think. We have to get rid of or transform every character, eventually forming our target.

Okay, here's the breakdown:
We need to turn 'BCCBDDEC' into 'DCDCDCBCCBEFEC'. Rule 3 allows us to reach the empty string, from this value, which we should reach from a sequential process. Thus we try and convert using only rules one until the target is reached. Rule 2 is obviously wrong, given this strategy.

'BCCBDDEC' can undergo `DD`->`EF` and be transformed into: 'BCCBDEFEC' We should convert the target `DCDCDCBCCBEFEC` into `DCDCDCBCCB(E)F(E)C`, which implies DD should show up for `EF`, and since the only other character differences are at the beginning we must move to using transformations with those characters first to achieve this state. Let us consider transforming 'B' and 'C' now using some combination of transformations or substitutions.
However, given that DD needs to show up near the end, perhaps this first step wasn't wise.

Let's rethink the entire approach, focusing on creating 'DCDCDCBCCBEFEC'. Looking at the original string, there is no path from 'BCCBDDEC' that yields to 'DCDCDCBCCBEFEC', thus meaning, we are not transforming it char by char into it.
Perhaps we look at simplifying the initial string such that it leads to easier use of rule 3 to get "".

Trying a different approach: Is there a way to reach a shorter string from BCCBDDEC and also leverage an altered rule 3?
Currently rule 3 wants an exact match. Let's analyze our initial state:
"BCCBDDEC".
We only have rule 1 available with rule 3 as the termination point, thus:
BCCBDDEC->BCCBEFEC - applying rule 1 `DD` -> `EF` once
Here, we examine our target: DCDCDCBCCBEFEC. 
The presence of BEFEC already near the end should lead us to this.
Our first difference is therefore only at the DCDCDCBCC left side. However we need to start on the LHS string. It starts with 'BCC'. If these changed, maybe there can exist another useful approach. We realize this transformation method requires the rule3 to be edited to the final solution, so this means there exists some character string, where substitutions, with our limited transitions can cause this string. However, given the state of the initial string, if no change leads to it, there also could imply there are no string substitutions applicable for the transitions to work at all! Thus our deduction will be [].

Since there must be some path available to transform initial_string -> "" it can only be this when this form yields an empty string output.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[]}$
