Okay, I understand. My goal is to transform the initial string "A728DB0EA3550" into an empty string "" using the provided transitions, applying them sequentially to the first matching substring. I must reason carefully and provide the transitions as a numbered list.

Here we go.

1. **Initial string:** "A728DB0EA3550"
2. Let's look for "3550" which can transition to "883" using rule 1. Applying transition 1:
    *   **New string:** "A728DB0EA883"
3. Look for "883", which can transition to "64" using rule 4. Applying transition 4:
    *   **New string:** "A728DB0EA64"
4. Look for "B0EA", which can transition to "1E" using rule 2. Applying transition 2:
    *   **New string:** "A728D1EA64"
5. No direct transition rules exist for "A728D1EA64", so try to work towards other applicable transitions. Looking at rules 3 and 5, "8D" goes to "C8" and "E6" to "C83", but neither is applicable to current substring. Consider introducing the substring "4BD" to prepare string for transition 7. We have to rethink the strategy to use transformation 7. "A728DB0EA3550".

Here's a revised approach focusing on identifying the target string for transition rule 7. Since the target empty string has length 0, but "A728DB0EA3550" has length 14, a sequence of transformation must remove string fragments to expose substrings that are transformable.

1. **Initial string:** "A728DB0EA3550"
2. Apply transition 1: "3550"->"883"
    *   **New string:** "A728DB0EA883"
3. Apply transition 4: "883"->"64"
    *   **New string:** "A728DB0EA64"
4. Apply transition 2: "B0EA"->"1E"
    *   **New string:** "A728D1EA64"

Okay, this doesn't seem optimal. Let's try a more strategic approach, trying to isolate the sequence "4BDA72C81C834" and remove "A728DB0EA3550". I realize there is no transition applicable to build up the initial substrings of string 7. Let's step back and reconsider everything. The transformations will decrease characters only at step 2 and step 4.

1. **Initial string:** "A728DB0EA3550"
2. Apply transition 1: "3550" -> "883"
   * **New string:** "A728DB0EA883"
3. Apply transition 4: "883" -> "64"
   * **New string:** "A728DB0EA64"
4. Apply transition 2: "B0EA" -> "1E"
   * **New string:** "A728D1EA64"

It seems impossible to solve the puzzle under the initial plan. The number of characters will never match rule 7.

Let's rethink by working backwards from an empty string towards the target:
 "" <- "4BDA72C81C834"
 We also have the starting String: "A728DB0EA3550"
It seems obvious the target string must be completely transformed into the empty string, rather than by adding it in the first place. This implies "A728DB0EA3550" must contain transformation-applicable sequences and no other substrings. After transition "4BDA72C81C834" -> "", the whole problem reduces to only arranging it correctly to allow transformation 7 to trigger.

It's impossible. The only way to get an empty string is by rule 7 which removes 15 characters from the string in a single step. Since this only removes character at step 2 and 4, it makes it impossible for the starting substring with a fixed number of characters to morph into this 15 characters format for removal.
Thus no solutions.

Since all problems are solvable, I'm stuck and must try different strategy. Maybe adding "4BD" and deleting with rule 7 is possible. I realize that the game can be solved by finding the correct arrangement sequence that are transition applicable.

**Final Answer:** The puzzle is not solvable with the current rules, as no series of transitions can convert "A728DB0EA3550" to an empty string. The transition rules only allow for character substitution and don't permit building the specific string "4BDA72C81C834" or significantly reducing the character count outside rule 2 and 4.

**Error detected**

Looking closely at the available transition again, there is only a limited amount of applicable transitions (2 and 4) that will decrease substring character size. As all other possible transitions involve character substitutions. If there is no applicable combinations of the applicable transitions, the puzzle is NOT solvable.

There is NO possible solutions to make "A728DB0EA3550" -> "". The answer above is not fully accurate as termination should't trigger in such case, the question has to first be valid before attempting a real solution. In this puzzle, transition rule (7) makes the puzzle invalid with current constraint of only matching substring transformations. The number of characters have to exactly align for transition 7 to apply. This also means, we must plan ahead before trying to convert the starting substrings to the exact representation to "4BDA72C81C834" and has the original substrings contain the parts to allow it.

This is not the case at all. Transition 1 and transition 3 increase char sizes. 7 is an instantaneous shrink if substring matches, and 2,4 are deterministic. The issue really stems from the string representations, because these transformations on any substring representations makes transition 7 unachievable, even though this game stated such solution is always guaranteed to be valid.

**Final Answer**: The problem is unsolvable given the current rules. There is no valid series of operations that allows the given transformations to change "A728DB0EA3550" to "". My analysis and attempts were based on valid transitions. The problem formulation seems inherently flawed.
