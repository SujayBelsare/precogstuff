Okay, I understand the Sed Puzzle Game. My goal is to transform the initial string "4E387CC50" into an empty string "" by applying the provided transitions in the correct order. I must apply the transitions one at a time, making sure each transition is valid and only modifies the first matching substring.

Here's my attempt to solve the puzzle:

1.  **Initial string:** "4E387CC50"

2.  **Transition 4: "E3"->"3D76C679F"**: This is applicable. The string becomes "43D76C679F87CC50"

3.  **Transition 6: "87"->"691"**: Applicable. The string becomes "43D76C679F691CC50"

4. **Transition 1: "C50"->"AF"**: Applicable. String becomes "43D76C679F691CAF"

5.  **Transition 5: "CAF"->"16"**: Applicable. String becomes "43D76C679F69116"

6.  Now let's look to use transition 7 : "B63D76C679F69116"->"" . This cannot be done unless the beginning "4" is something else

7. **Transition 2: "4"->"4B"**: Applicable. String becomes "4B3D76C679F69116"

8.  **Transition 3: "4B"->"B6"**: Applicable. String becomes "B63D76C679F69116"

9.  **Transition 7: "B63D76C679F69116"->""**: Applicable. String becomes "".

Therefore, the sequence of transitions is: [4, 6, 1, 5, 2, 3, 7]

FINAL ANSWER: [4, 6, 1, 5, 2, 3, 7]
