Okay, let's analyze this problem meticulously.

Initial String: "DBFFA"
Transitions:
1) "DBFF"->"DFF"
2) ""->"EF"
3) "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->""

Goal: ""

This is a tricky one because of transition 2, which introduces "EF". It looks like we need to *build* the string "EFEFEFEFDFFA" and then eliminate it in one go.  Since we start with "DBFFA", we want to transform this into something that could lead us closer to "EFEFEFEFDFFA".

Looking at rule 3, the end portion "DFFA" is interesting and very useful.

Let's start:
"DBFFA".  How do we add some Es and Fs at the front? Let's start with the empty string. We can create some empty string if we reduce DBFF->DFF.  But that will cause problems so lets keep "DBFFA".  We need to figure out how to *add* E's and F's.  Transition 2 inserts "EF". So, somehow, we need to delete the entire string "DBFFA". We CANNOT do that. So something might be wrong with that deduction...

However, we can start by building the sequence backwards.
"EFEFEFEFDFFA". Before this, maybe it was nothing "". And we somehow applied ""->"EF" many times... which seems impossible. So let's try to build some stuff.
We need to somehow change DBFFA into EFEFEFEFDFFA

1)DBFF->DFF
"DBFFA" using transition 1, "DBFF"->"DFF" gets us "DFFA" which is the *end* part of rule 3, we need the starting "EFEFEFEF". We can never add it! What about reducing DFFA. No way.
Lets backtrack our thought.
We are given that the string is mathematically proven to be solvable. So there exists a sequence!
"DBFFA"
The main transition that eliminates something big is "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->""

Final try: Let's rethink this.
Initial: DBFFA

If transition 3 is "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->"", that means that we can eliminate "EFEFEFEFDFFA" completely. How do we get the EFEFEFEF *IN FRONT*? Rule 2 introduces "EF", but there's no way to force rule 2.

Let's try this:
The final part has to be DFFA. That should give us a hint. So we somehow need to transform "DBF" into "EFEFEFEF".

But look closer, we don't have to change into a "strict" EFEFEF. Maybe DFF has to turn into EFEFEF some how.
1. DBFF->DFF
So DBFFA->DFFFA, that gets us closer since we are removing elements. What we can we do about "DFFFA"? We're stuck!

Final Final Try: Think outside of the box...is there any assumption about using all rules?

Initial: DBFFA

If we apply ONLY transition 2 ""->"EF" over and over...will the program STOP EVER?! IT won't stop, therefore that must mean we MUST use Rule 3!

Let's restart.
Initial: DBFFA
Need to create "EFEFEFEFDFFA".
So somehow, DBFF turns into "EFEFEFEF"
After some struggle I realize the puzzle is unsolvable, as none of the operations are able to help construct the required string. It is a trap!

I therefore report that there's no solution for this puzzle.

```
There is no possible transformation.
