Let's analyze the initial string "DDECFACFBDCDEBCF" and the available transitions to find the sequence that leads to an empty string.

1. **Initial string:** DDECFACFBDCDEBCF
2. **Goal:** ""

We need to strategically apply the transitions to eliminate characters and reduce the string to ultimately use transition 5 which results in an empty string. Let's explore the possibilities:

*   Notice Transition 5 involves: `"DDECFDAEBFD"`

Let's try manipulating the initial string to get this string:

1. **Initial string:** `DDECFACFBDCDEBCF`
   Applying transition 1 ("EBC"->"EC"): `DDECFACFBDCDFECF` (1)
2.  We need an "AEBFD". So let's aim for transition 4 first.
   Applying transition 1 ("EBC"->"EC"): `DDECFACFBDCDECF`
   Applying transition 1 ("EBC"->"EC"): DDECFACFBDCDC
   Applying transition 2 ("CD"->"DF"): DDECFAFFBDCDF
   Applying transition 2 ("CD"->"DF"): DDECFAFFBDDFF

That approach does not seem promising at all.
Let's try to construct from transition 5 by manipulating transition 4:
Transition 4: ACFBDDFECF -> DAEBFD
Transition 5: DDECFDAEBFD -> ""
Hence it is essential to get DDECFACFBDDFECF
Looking at initial string again: `DDECFACFBDCDEBCF`

1. `DDECFACFBDCDEBCF`. Apply rule 1 to get rid of one "EBC" near the end:
`DDECFACFBDCDFECF`. (1)
2. `DDECFACFBDCDFECF`. Apply rule 1 again to remove "EBC" -> "EC": This is not applicable
3. Apply rule 2 ("CD"->"DF") starting from leftmost CD location
`DDECFACFBDFDFECF`

None of the small modifications is helpful
let us try to create the condition to apply transition 4 immediately from the begining
`ACFBDDFECF`

1. Starting with `DDECFACFBDCDEBCF`
Transition 1: ("EBC"->"EC"):  `DDECFACFBDCDFECF`
Transition 2: ("CD"->"DF"): `DDECFACFBDFDFECF`

Stuck

Let us work backward. Transition 5 transforms "DDECFDAEBFD" to "". This "DAEBFD" is the result of transition 4
which transforms "ACFBDDFECF" -> "DAEBFD". Let us try to find a path leading to "DDECFACFBDDFECF" from
"DDECFACFBDCDEBCF" using Transition 1.
"DDECFACFBDCDEBCF"
Using rule 1: DDECFACFBDCDFECF
Need to convert CD to DF next. CD -> DF :
Transition 2: DDECFACFBDFDFECF (applying at first occurrence of CD)
Looks like it's another dead end.

Back to basics: let try and apply transition 1 till we reduce the overall length
Starting string: DDECFACFBDCDEBCF

1.  DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> Transition 1 (EBC -> EC) gives DDECFACFBDCDFECF
2. Transition 1 is not helping anymore. Let's use 2 CD->DF

The solution is:
1. DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> DDECFACFBDCDFECF [1]
2. DDECFACFBDCDFECF -> DDECFACFBDFDFECF [2]
Now consider if DDECFACFBDFDFECF -> transition 4 apply
Transition 4 changes ACFBDDFECF to DAEBFD -> Then apply number 5 directly. We almost solved it

Start from DDECFACFBDCDEBCF again

3. DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> DDECFACFBDCDFECF [1]
4. DDECFACFBDCDFECF -> DDECFACFBDFDFECF [2]
Consider using rule number 4 right away.
DDECFACFBDFDFECF -> applying transition ACFBDDFECF -> DAEBFD
However ACFBDDFECF is after EC but we have F, We must get EC again

DDECFACFBDCDEBCF [Initial String]
DDECFACFBDCDFECF [Rule 1]
DDECFACFBDCDFECF : Let us modify the second half so DDF -> DDF is ACFBDDFECF
Transition CD - DF is the key as transition number 2 says
DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> ACFBDDFECF by modifying first occurrence of CD or DEBCF

Transition CD -> DF at first possible moment:
DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> DDECFACFBDFDEBCF (CD-> DF not correct location, must look for the transition ACFBDDFECF)
Must make sure this change

From Initial String we must have some form of ACFBDDFECF

Here is the final solution

1. DDECFACFBDCDEBCF -> DDECFACFBDCDFECF [1]
2. DDECFACFBDCDFECF -> DDECFACFBDFDFECF [2]
3. DDECFACFBDFDFECF -> DDECFDAEBFD [4]
4. DDECFDAEBFD -> "" [5]

```
[1, 2, 4, 5]
