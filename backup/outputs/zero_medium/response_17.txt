Okay, I understand the rules of the Sed Puzzle Game. I must transform the initial string "BDEEEFC" into an empty string "" using the provided transitions. I must list the transitions in the order they are applied. Let's begin!

Initial String: "BDEEEFC"

1. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
   "BDEEEFC" becomes "BDEEEBE"

2. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEEEBE" becomes "BDEFEEBE"

3. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEEBE"

4. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEFBE"

5. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFFEFBE" becomes "BDEFFEFEBE"

6. Apply transition 4: "BBDEFEEB"->"EBBB"
The string currently is BDEFFEFEBE, so we have to get to that pattern.
Let us change the order. Start with transitions 3 on all E.

1. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDEEEFC" becomes "BDEEEFC" -> "BDFEFEEEFC"

2. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDFEFEEEFC" becomes "BDFFEFEEFC"

3. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDFFEFEEFC" becomes "BDFFEFFEFC"

4. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDFFEFFEFC" becomes "BDFFEFFFFC"

5. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
"BDFFEFFFFC" becomes "BDFFEFFFBE"

At this point it is impossible to use transition 4.
Back to start:
Initial String: "BDEEEFC"

1. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
"BDEEEFC" becomes "BDEEEBE"

2. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDEEEBE" becomes "BDEFEEBE"

3. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDEFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEEBE"

4. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDEFFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEFBE"

5. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDEFFEFBE" becomes "BDEFFEFEBE"

This seems long. Lets start applying CB. Can't, as there is nothing there.
Apply BE -> AB where possible. No matches.
Back to basics.

Initial String: "BDEEEFC"

1. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
   "BDEEEFC" becomes "BDEEEBE"

2. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEEEBE" becomes "BDEFEEBE"

3. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEEBE"

4. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFFEEBE" becomes "BDEFFEFBE"

5. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF"
   "BDEFFEFBE" becomes "BDEFFEFEBE"

Apply 5: "BE"->"AB" - No.

Apply transition 4: "BBDEFEEB"->"EBBB" - Does not match. We need a double B.
We need to manipulate this thing. Lets try this sequence:

1. transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
"BDEEEFC"->"BDEEEBE"

2. transition 5: "BE"->"AB"
"BDEEEBE"->"BDEEEAB"

We will need some BB patterns to be created.
Start with creating multiple BE's.

1. transition 3: "E"->"EF" - Three times:
"BDEEEFC" -> "BDFEFEEFC" -> "BDFFEFEEFC" -> "BDFFEFFEFC"

2. transition 3: "E"->"EF"
"BDFFEFFEFC" -> "BDFFEFFFFC"

3. transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
"BDFFEFFFFC" -> "BDFFEFFFBE"

It's hard to reason about this sequence. Let's try to apply transition 6 as much as possible.
"CEBBAB"->"" means we need a CEBBAB sequence somehow. Let's try and force this.

1. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
"BDEEEFC" -> "BDEEEBE"

Now what? Let's enumerate from the beginning:
1. Apply transition 1: "FC"->"BE"
BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE

2. Apply transition 3: "E"->"EF" - four times
BDEEEBE -> BDEFEEBE -> BDEFFEEBE -> BDEFFEFBE -> BDEFFEFEBE

We want BB in the beginning, so somehow, we need to create BB.
Lets consider:
Transition 4: "BBDEFEEB"->"EBBB". Notice how you obtain extra B's here. The key seems to be "transition 4"

"BBDEFEEB"->"EBBB"
"BDEEEFC"

1. transition 1: FC -> BE
BDEEEBE

Now lets find BBDEFEEB sequence somewhere.
Transition 4 converts to EBBB - 3 B's.

Let us apply 3 repetitively:
"E"->"EF" - repeatedly.

1. transition 3
BDEEEBE -> BDEFEEBE
2. transition 3
BDEFEEBE -> BDEFFEEBE
3. transition 3
BDEFFEEBE -> BDEFFEFBE
4. transition 3
BDEFFEFBE -> BDEFFEFEBE

Now we have BDEFFEFEBE
Transition 4 is BBDEFEEB -> EBBB
We don't see the pattern. This will lead us nowhere. Let us explore a completely different approach.

I will apply a depth-first search approach. From current strings apply each of available rules. Terminate when it gets to more than 10 operations. I will terminate as it will consume all remaining runtime and this does not give deterministic method of solving the puzzle.

Here's my attempt with backtracking:

1. FC->BE. BDEEEFC becomes BDEEEBE
2.  E->EF: BDEEEBE becomes BDEFEEBE.
3. BE->AB. BDEEEBE becomes BDEEEAB
Let us examine "BDEEEAB". Now if we get CEBBAB, this removes completely!

FC, "", E->EF, BBDEFEEB->EBBB, BE->AB, CEBBAB

Initial: BDEEEFC

Let us convert the beginning BDEEE into CEBBAB.
We can't. Nothing happens to it. Transition 6 is only CEBBAB -> empty.
CEBBAB doesn't seem to be something obtainable.
Going back again. Starting afresh.
Applying rule #1, BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE. So we changed one "FC" substring to "BE". The substring's original start index will be the target of our next applications of the production rules to complete conversion to "", and at some number of remaining transformations equal to a finite number.
Applying the rules in one-to-many ways leads to a search tree that can grow quickly but the application and validation each time through that tree is bounded in constant time.

Applying the final depth=4 limited iterations for various possibilities:

Okay, here's my final answer:

1. **1**: FC -> BE.  `BDEEEFC` becomes `BDEEEBE`
2. **5**: BE -> AB. `BDEEEBE` becomes `BDEEEAB`

At this stage it gets exponentially complicated. But I should try to convert BDEEEAB to become CEBBAB
Which cannot be easily achieved, nor through brute force.
