Okay, I understand. I will approach this problem systematically, applying the transitions carefully and documenting each step. My goal is to reduce "DFEEFDECFDCABBA" to an empty string.

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"

1. Apply transition 1 to "E":
   "DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"

2. Apply transition 1 to "E":
   "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA"

3. Apply transition 1 to "E":
   "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA"

4. Apply transition 2 to "DFCCEFDE":
   "DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA" -> This does NOT contain DFCCEFDE so we cannot perform this.

Let's backtrack and explore other possibilities. Let's try applying the rules in another order.

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"

1. Apply transition 1 to "E":
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"

Now we have the subsequence "DFCCEFDE" so we can try rule 2.
2. Apply transition 2 to "DFCCEFDE":
"DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA"

This actually seems to make things more complicated. Let's rethink the approach.
The final step must be to apply rule 4, so we should be aiming towards "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA".

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"

1. Apply transition 1 three times to eliminate the first 3 "E" characters.
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"
2. Apply transition 1 again
"DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA"
3. Apply transition 1 again
"DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA"

Maybe transition 4 is intended to erase long substrings with DCC in them...

Going back to basics and applying the rules without any long term planning...
Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
1. Apply transition 1
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"

2. Apply transition 2:
"DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA"
Let us keep trying rule 1 to see where it will lead us to:
3. Apply transition 1:
"BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA" // no applicable 'E'

That gives us "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA".
Not going to the end point. Going back...

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
1. apply transition 1 to first E
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"

Now we have a "DFCCEFDE" in our string so maybe transition 2 should be the next step:
2. apply transition 2 to "DFCCEFDE"
"DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA"

Applying transition 1 gives BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA, no progress.

It seems transition 2 is what blocks the puzzle. So let's just apply transition 1 until it's gone.
Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
1. transition 1: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"

If we don't use transition 2 now, we have to use transition 1 three times and end up with DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA. So let's go with transition 2 next.
2. transition 2: "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA"

If we can get the first few characters the same as string in transition 4, then it is likely we are on the right track. 
So let's use transition 1 on "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA" three times.
3. transition 1: "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA" -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA" Not applicable

Since rule 1 cannot be used, this means transition 2 doesn't move us forward and we shouldn't use it at all.

Start again!

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
We need to eliminate the prefix "DF". Rule 3 may achieve this so try to transform this towards it. This seems futile...
However, if we consider the final form "" and work backward, we need transition 4 "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA"->"" so
the final 1st step must be to get that substring in our main string. The "DCA"->"DC" transition doesn't bring us closer.
And "E"->"CC" is simple expansion.

"DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
1. Apply transition 1 to the first E "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"
2. Apply transition 1 to the second E "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA"
3. Apply transition 1 to the third E "DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA"

We can only make one assumption here. Assume "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA" can appear anywhere, not only the initial portion of the main string. Then the goal becomes just to make our main string contain that as a substring and then we just apply rule 4 and finish!

What can transition 2 accomplish? Let's try transition 2 after using transition 1.
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" (rule 1) -> "BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA"

This doesn't contain BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA.
I see no possible moves. There has to be a simple solution...I've been defeated. The problem description promised that a solution always exists. Let's try a random answer, perhaps I am thinking about the "only modifies the first matching substring" part wrong.

[1, 1, 1, 4]

Let's work it out,
initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
rule 1: "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"
rule 1: "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA"
rule 1: "DFCCCCCCFDECFDCABBA"

No matching expression for rule 4 now... I am officially stumped. However since termination is implied for wrong answer, I should abstain from guessing now and accept this challenge's conclusion.
