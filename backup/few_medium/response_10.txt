Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem with the given rules and transitions.

Initial string: "BCBADDCC"

Available transitions:
1) "DDC"->"ED"
2) "A"->"DF"
3) "BCBDFEDC"->"BECF"
4) "F"->"FD"
5) "BECFDD"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 2 to the "A" in "BCBADDCC":
BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC

Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the "DDC" in "BCBDFDCC":
BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFEDC

Step 3: Apply transition 3 to "BCBDFEDC" in "BCBDFEDC":
BCBDFEDC -> BECF

Step 4: Apply transition 4 to the "F" in "BECF":
BECF -> BECFFD

Step 5: Apply transition 4 to the first "F" in "BECFFD":
BECFFD -> BECFFDD

Step 6: Apply transition 5 to the "BECFDD" in "BECFFDD":
BECFFDD -> FD

Step 7: Apply transition 4 to the "F" in "FD"
FD -> FDD

We are stuck.
Let us try a different strategy
Initial string: "BCBADDCC"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the "DDC" in "BCBADDCC":
BCBADDCC -> BCBAED

Now we're in trouble.

Initial string: "BCBADDCC"

Step 1: Apply transition 2 to the "A" in "BCBADDCC":
BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC

Step 2: Apply transition 4 to the first "F" in "BCBDFDCC":
BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFDDCC

Let us try an alternate path:

Initial string: "BCBADDCC"
Step 1: apply transition 1 to "DDC" in "BCBADDCC":
BCBADDCC -> BCBAED

From this route we are now in trouble, the A has no neighbours to form a string that is in any of the transitions available. Let us go back to the drawing board.

Initial string: "BCBADDCC"

Step 1: Apply transition 2 to the "A" in "BCBADDCC":
BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC
Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the "DDC" in BCBDFDCC:
BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFEDC
Step 3: Apply transition 3 to the "BCBDFEDC" in BCBDFEDC
BCBDFEDC -> BECF

Step 4: Apply transition 4 to the "F" in "BECF":
BECF -> BECFFD
Step 5: Apply transition 4 to the "F" in "BECFFD"
BECFFD -> BECFFDD
Step 6: Apply transition 5 to BECFFDD,
BECFFDD -> FD
Step 7: Apply Transition 4 to "F" in "FD":
FD -> FDD

It Seems the transition 4 keeps causing an infinite loop because, after you transition, transition 5 can't apply because of the extra "D" on BECF**DD**. I am sure this can be solved so something must be done to prevent this loop. Let's investigate more complex transitions.
Step 1: Transition (2) "A"->"DF":
BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC
Step 2: Transition (4) "F"->"FD":
BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFDDCC

Let's restart the entire approach.

Initial string: "BCBADDCC"

Step 1: transition 2 "A"->"DF": BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC
Step 2: transition 1 "DDC"->"ED": BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFEDC
Step 3: transition 3 "BCBDFEDC"->"BECF": BCBDFEDC -> BECF
Step 4: transition 4 "F"->"FD": BECF -> BECFFD
Step 5: transition 4 "F"->"FD": BECFFD -> BECFFDD
Step 6: transition 5 "BECFDD"->"": BECFFDD -> FD
Step 7: transition 4 "F"->"FD": FD -> FDD

Still Stuck and cannot avoid infinite loops. What about targeting C instead?

Start "BCBADDCC"

Step 1. No Rules apply directly to C's available except for "DDC"->"ED" after you get two D's. let us use A and D
Step 1. Apply rule 2  "A"->"DF": BCBADDCC -> BCBDFDCC
Step 2. Apply rule 1 "DDC"->"ED": BCBDFDCC -> BCBDFEDC
Step 3. Apply rule 3 "BCBDFEDC"->"BECF": BCBDFEDC -> BECF
Step 4. Apply rule 4 "F"->"FD": BECF -> BECFFD
Step 5. Apply rule 4 "F"->"FD": BECFFD -> BECFFDD
Step 6. Apply rule 5 "BECFDD"->"": BECFFDD -> FD
Step 7. Apply rule 4 "F"->"FD": FD -> FDD -> loop and fail

Since only **BECFDD -> ""** deletes BECF, how can it be made without making "FFDD".

Trying another avenue

"BCBADDCC"
Step 1 : Use rule (1) DDC -> ED

"BCBAED" Now how can an ED Be exploited and what rules lead to BECF?
**DDC** -> **ED**

I need to think of how I can make a double D and a C to get BECF and rule (5), let us go over them again one at a time.

Step 1. Starting State = "BCBADDCC"
Step 2. 2, applies to A = "BCBDFDCC"
Step 3. 4, applies to F = "BCBDFDDCC"
Step 4. 1, applies to DDC ="BCBDFEDC"
Step 5. 3 applies directly since there it contains "BCBDFEDC" = BECF
Step 6. F to FD Rule 4 "BECFFD"
Step 7. F to FD again Rule 4 "BECFFDD"
Step 8. BecfDD Rule 5 becomes nothing! "" solved, Let's write the transitions now.
[2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
FINAL ANSWER: [2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
