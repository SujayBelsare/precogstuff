Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully to find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "CBAEF"

Available transitions:
1) "F"->"DE"
2) "DE"->"AC"
3) "CBAEAC"->"BE"
4) ""->"AC"
5) "ACACBE"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the initial string.
CBAEF -> CBAEDE
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 2.
CBAEDE -> CBAEAC
[1, 2]

Step 3: Apply transition 3
CBAEAC -> BE
[1, 2, 3]

Step 4: I need to introduce "AC" next to "BE" such that it could become ACACBE by introducing "AC" to the left side. In this case I use ""->"AC" to add AC to the begining of string.
BE -> ACBE
[1,2,3,4]
(I added at beginning of string)

Step 5: Introducing "AC" again to get desired sequence.
ACBE -> ACACBE
[1,2,3,4,4]

Step 6: Finally use transition 5
ACACBE -> ""
[1,2,3,4,4,5]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]}$
