Okay, I understand. I am ready to play the Sed Puzzle Game. My goal is to convert the initial string "45F7D" into an empty string "" using the provided transitions in the specified manner. I will proceed meticulously, verifying each transition before application to avoid errors.

Initial string: "45F7D"

1. Apply transition 2: "D"->"FE9E96"
   String becomes: "45F7FE9E96"

2. No possible operation seems viable, so backtrack to start
Initial string: "45F7D"

1. Since transition 5 requires a very large string as initial substring to become empty, it cannot be immediately useful
2. Looking at other transitions to prepare string for transition 5

Let's consider transition 2 first: "D"->"FE9E96"
String becomes: "45F7FE9E96"

Next, we need to introduce "A" using transition 1. "F"->"FA" doesn't seem helpful directly because it would only increase the string size
Considering target substring "A8F96345" for transition 4, we would need to obtain the sequence A8F96 somewhere. We can also check transition 3 for this.
Apply transition 3 repeatedly might yield results

We backtrack to the start
Initial String: "45F7D"

Transition 2: "D"->"FE9E96"
String becomes: "45F7FE9E96"

Apply transition 3: "E9E"->"72A1A8F"
String becomes: "45F7F72A1A8F96"

Apply transition 4: "A8F96345"->"2338B56C52". There is "A8F96" so append "345" to it first, or replace with A8F96345 with transition 4 and transition 5 after it.
We could generate it starting by 1), adding some A's here and there and combining with other operations. It does not look promising to obtain.
Let's look at other transitions, especially the reverse, to get closer to "" from "45F7FE9E96". 
None of these transitions are useful because these string fragments "45" and "7" and "FE" does not appear inside those replacements.

So let us consider "45F7D" and look from other routes that possibly yield correct results
Since all of them do not directly act on initial sequence, we have to combine steps in sequence such as repeatedly using 2) and 3).

Applying 2), then 3), we have "45F7FE9E96" then "45F7F72A1A8F96"
Apply 1 to the existing two "F", then to the substring of form "FA".

But these approaches are not looking promising because the chain reaction may easily yield sequence which we have no reverse form, for example sequence containing a mixture of D, A, and F and etc which would result in longer strings

Let us consider some invariants, the length change after using each operation.
1 increases by 1
2 increases by 5
3 increases by 5
4 increases by 2
5 decreases by 21

Initial "45F7D", which has length 5. The transitions are always adding more than taking away so transition 5 will eventually be used, since solution is always there and is proved to exists.
The question is, is there a state that yields substring for 5 from start?

Since 5) gives "", "FAF72A12338B56C52F7FE9E96".
Consider "45F7D". Using only 1, 2, 3, 4, we have to eventually reach some order in between 5).

Transition 2 "D"->"FE9E96" looks promising.
String: "45F7FE9E96"

Transition 3 "E9E"->"72A1A8F" looks promising.
String: "45F7F72A1A8F96"

I seem to be stuck again, maybe I missed an important part?
Let's try a totally different approach and list necessary component string parts inside "FAF72A12338B56C52F7FE9E96" and find "F72A1", "2338", "C52F7FE9E96" separately.
The reason it doesn't have a solution may be because transition 4 contains 345 inside it, where in start it is "45", which creates a mismatch which may never yield solution.

Let's consider some reverse way if these transitions are bidirectional to get some idea, they are not

Let us exhaust some case analysis starting with transition 1 to see whether pattern can emerge.
1.  "45F7D"->"45FA7D" then transition 2 yields "45FA7FE9E96"
What if from left to right the answer exists by looking up transition to existing answer?
F7... is a part.
5 has form F(A?)F(7...
If the operation were reversible, one can start from null. The lack of reversibility and initial mismatch 4 vs 3 means very delicate sequences of operation, it won't always be adding string parts to a substring of another sequence of states.

Looking through transitions and final form repeatedly does not allow any easier shortcut. We consider other search strategies
Depth limited DFS, starting from state to see if it solves within reasonable limits. I shall stick to the logic first.
From current logic I am stuck. Since time is of essence I have to submit an answer soon. So I resort to more primitive way.

Considering random actions and backtracking does not yield answers. This problem has complexity of roughly at least O(n^5) to go around since the average incrementing size from each operations and final goal. Considering each node with each action to exhaust is hard.

After attempting exhaustive search mentally, the solution is still beyond me and this is where world champion lose games.
Considering time, let us try a random approach just to provide output,
[2,3,4]

45F7D
45F7FE9E96
45F7F72A1A8F96
45F7F2338B56C52

It doesnt look plausible

Since running out of attempt lets revaluate it

Start from "45F7D" -> "": Requires substring "FAF72A12338B56C52F7FE9E96" somewhere
2)D->FE9E96" yields: F"E9E"96 so try to transform with "E9E"
2) then 3) "45F7D"->"45F7FE9E96"->"45F7F72A1A8F96"

let me retry the previous 2,3 action again
Applying transition 2: "D"->"FE9E96"
"45F7FE9E96"

Applying transition 3: "E9E"->"72A1A8F"
"45F7F72A1A8F96"

Seeing that '45' doesnt match I should remove these, 4 or 5 since the goal contains F start somewhere I assume removing these 4 and 5 with operations are first step, but these is too large.

2 then 3
The above step seems mandatory after checking. Then what is other approach that possibly yields correct answer is 1 before all this to change structure since the start mismatchs
45F7D, then transition 1 to 45FA7D
2 3 sequence won't work because no F.
Applying transition 5 now looks viable but substring mismatch as usual

Ok, give up, my reasoning fails somewhere due to inherent complexity of transitions.

FINAL ANSWER: [2, 3]
