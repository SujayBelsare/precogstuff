Okay, let's start the Sed Puzzle Game. My goal is to transform the initial string "3EDC5" into an empty string "" using the given transitions.

Initial String: "3EDC5"

1.  Apply transition 1: "3E" -> "94"
    String becomes: "94DC5"

2.  Apply transition 2: "4DC5" -> "91"
    String becomes: "991"

3.  Apply transition 3: "99" -> "334C6"
    String becomes: "334C61"

4.  Apply transition 6: "1" -> "4E"
    String becomes: "334C64E"

5. Since there are no "3E", "4DC5", "99", or "EE" at the start, and "1" has already been transitioned away, we should try building towards the removal transition, namely number 7 which looks for "A534C64E". Thus we must get an A5 and remove the extra "3". Thus we transition through 5 using "EE3" -> "A5". But that substring is not at the start. Thus, to make the pattern of transition 7, let's create an "EE" using transition 4 and then use transition 5:

    Apply transition 4: "" -> "EE" (this is not useful since it'll attach at start)
    Back to "334C64E", it will only cause trouble.

    So, the plan to make "A534C64E" has to take another form.
6. String "334C64E"

Since there are no further obvious transitions for string "334C64E", we need to change something for further use of other transitions. Let's back up and try a new strategy.
Since there are no "3E", "4DC5", "99", or "EE" at the start, and "1" has already been transitioned away.

Initial String: "3EDC5"

1. Apply transition 1: "3E" -> "94"
    String becomes: "94DC5"
2. Apply transition 2: "4DC5" -> "91"
    String becomes: "991"

3. Apply transition 3: "99" -> "334C6"
   String becomes: "334C61"

4.  Apply transition 6: "1" -> "4E"
    String becomes: "334C64E"

The trick here is we want to change the "3" to A5, thus we need it to become "EE3"

Initial String: "3EDC5"
1.  Apply transition 1: "3E" -> "94"
    String becomes: "94DC5"

2.  Apply transition 2: "4DC5" -> "91"
    String becomes: "991"

3. Apply transition 3: "99" -> "334C6"
    String becomes: "334C61"

4.  Apply transition 6: "1" -> "4E"
    String becomes: "334C64E"

5.  Apply transition 4: "" -> "EE"
    String becomes: "EE334C64E"

6.  Apply transition 5: "EE3" -> "A5"
    String becomes: "A534C64E"

7.  Apply transition 7: "A534C64E" -> ""
    String becomes: ""

Final Answer: \[1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7]
