Let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "BDACCEFEFBD". The goal is to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
2) "D"->"AE"
3) "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""

Notice that the only way to achieve the empty string is by applying transition 3 at the end. This implies our objective is to eventually transform the initial string to "BAEACCAEAEBD".

Initial string: "BDACCEFEFBD"

Let's try applying transition 1 to see if it gets us closer. The string contains "EFEFBD" so applying rule 1:
"BDACCEFEFBD" -> "BDACCDDBD"

That doesn't seem to get us closer to our desired string. Let's try to use transition 2, which replaces 'D' with "AE". It appears twice so lets look at both possibilities one at a time:
- Applying it to first "D": "BDACCEFEFBD" -> "BAEACCEFEFBD"
- Applying it to second "D": "BDACCEFEFBD" -> "BDACCEFEFAEB"
- Applying it to third "D": "BDACCEFEFBD" -> "BDACCEFEFBAE"
- Applying it to fourth "D": "BDACCEFEFBD" -> "BDACCEFEFBAE"

Starting with applying to the first 'D', now the string is "BAEACCEFEFBD". We want "BAEACCAEAEBD"
If we can get 'CCEFEFBD' to 'CCAEAEBD'.

We have "BAEACCEFEFBD"
Apply transition 1, replace "EFEFBD"->"DDBD":
"BAEACCDDBD"
Now we want "CCAEAEBD" and we have "CDDBD" so let's try transition 2 again:
"D"->"AE"
"BAEACCDDBD" -> "BAEACCAEAEBD"

Great, now we have "BAEACCAEAEBD" which we can reduce to empty string with transition 3.

So the transitions are:
1. D -> AE (2)
2. EFEFBD -> DDBD (1)
3. D -> AE (2)
4. BAEACCAEAEBD -> "" (3)

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 2, 3]}$
