Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully and find the correct sequence of transitions to transform "EDDAC" into an empty string.

Initial String: "EDDAC"

Available Transitions:
1) "EDDA" -> "FF"
2) "C" -> "CD"
3) "FFCDDD" -> ""

Step 1: Apply transition 1. This will change EDDA into FF.
EDDAC -> FFC

Step 2: Apply transition 2. This will change C into CD.
FFC -> FFCD

Now we have "FFCD". We need to get "FFCDDD" somehow. We can apply transition 2 two more times:
Step 3: Apply transition 2.
FFCD -> FFCDD

Step 4: Apply transition 2.
FFCDD -> FFCDDD

Step 5: Apply transition 3 to get an empty string:
FFCDDD -> ""

So, the sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}$
