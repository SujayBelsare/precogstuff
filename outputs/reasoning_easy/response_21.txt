Okay, let's analyze this Sed Puzzle Game problem with the available transitions:

1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

Initial string: "CCBDA"

Goal: Convert "CCBDA" to "".

Let's break down the problem: We want to eventually get "EDEDEDCAA". To get to that string from our current string, the empty string production must be used, because that allows any arbitrary string as a transformation.
1. Applying rule 2 to the current string "CCBDA" gives "CAA". Now we've reduced "CCBDA" to "CAA". Thus, CCBDA -> CAA. [2]
2. If we look at "EDEDEDCAA" it has an appended string, "CAA", which looks like "CCBDA" was close to. This makes transition 3 promising. However, if the empty string could become "ED", we may be able to generate the "EDEDED..."

Since we already have the 'CAA' at the end, perhaps we want to work toward creating "EDEDED" using transition 1 and strategic insertion.

Let's work backwards from rule 3 and see what it requires. It must be preceded by "EDEDED". To produce such, an empty string must exist, but given an initial string such as ours, such never comes to exist.
The current string state is CAA
Going forward is difficult.

New Plan: Instead of "emptying" our string, let's reduce the beginning of the string "CCBDA" into "AA" at the very tail so that we can easily reduce the complexity for transition 3's string format by simply applying it as follows:
Transition list [2]. "CCBDA" -> "CAA".

To empty string, requires transition [3]. 
So the final transition should be [3].
But to reach the final transition state from our existing 'CAA', a few transitions must exist. Namely, from empty to "EDEDED".
Given "", insert "ED" repeatedly. Thus: ""->"ED"->"EDED"->"EDEDED". To concatenate CAA after each repetition leads to an issue because rule 3 looks for EDEDEDCAA, while the current string is CAA.

"CCBDA"
[2]: "CAA"
Stuck, start again
Another possible transformation is transition 3->2, as rule 3 contains rule 2 after removing the string from "" to ed transition, then maybe rule 2 allows such. Let's try applying rule 2 until it empties such. 

The string after applying rule 2 is "CAA".
Currently only can use nullstring transformation.
What happens if we reverse engineer the process from the required final string->"" using null string insertion (ED inserted until we match "EDEDEDCAA"). After CAA comes to the stage where it requires preceding substrings of ED repeated until EDEDEDCAA to reduce by transition rule 3.
[2]->CAA. Need to convert this to that to use Transition rule [3], can only use nullstring transformation and thus can not

There has to be another step because CAA can't turn to "EDEDEDCAA" using transition 1 only. Rule 3 is a trap! This has made it so difficult!

Let's see, given "" -> ED. If a reverse transition exists ""-> CBDA, which then by another transition becomes AA... it creates something in tail formation that's very long in production to solve by our given transformation array. This implies transitions must match up (or are more like shortcuts!) and the puzzle intends for shortcuts because else you can't reverse engineer or do things to strings in such manners, its length dependent.

The key may be in the order of operations

Ok! This is the correct solution

1. Apply rule 2. `CCBDA -> CAA` : [2]
2. Apply rule 1 6 times. (i.e. ""->"ED", ""->"ED", ...):[2,1,1,1,1,1,1] Result: `CAA` + `EDEDED` becomes `CAAEDEDED` . This leads to "CAAEDEDED". However, transitions ONLY modify the first substring, which implies rule 1 can't work like that. I need to insert these strings at the _beginning_, because that is what's only affected by transitions

Going back again...
[2]: CCBDA -> CAA
Reverse string. Reverse Engineer
Reverse engineer: can't reverse cause transition rules are one direction

Ah.. We need to find an invariant... an intermediate expression to solve the puzzle.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2]}$
```
Available transitions:
1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

Initial string: "CCBDA"
```

CCBDA -> CAA using rule 2
If you want to reduce CAA using rule 3, this cannot work because the transition rule does not satisfy the expression. However, that the answer is just [2] has been proven false
What is true is that using ED you may append multiple empty strings via such transformation which gets prepended instead
But how does such get made to CAA... it only gets CAA if the previous rule of CCBDA -> AA is satisfied in this case, which means you are always modifying one rule

Now, considering the CAA state, to use ED's substring, that must happen
I propose instead of trying to convert CAA, we attempt to see CCBDA. If you are already with a fixed end (a la appending vs prepending)
Prepending can never work due to transition of expressions one being replaced

I understand, as the substring of "" is at any position and only modifies ONE such, by using transition rule 1) many times before a string that matters such as the original, it creates strings on front.

Here we go... this should be correct for transition!

```
Available transitions:
1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

Initial string: "CCBDA"
```

1.  Apply transition rule 1) 6 times. As each empty string "" is valid to find, apply this at any position where this evaluates to true at the initial location CCBDA. In effect, add this ED string on the start
    CCBDA becomes EDEDEDEDCCBDA

    `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
    "EDEDEDCCBDA"

2.  Apply rule 2.
    EDEDEDCCBDA -> EDEDEDCAA.
    `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`

3. Apply rule 3
     "EDEDEDCAA" -> ""
     This is the last and terminal step!
       `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]`

```python
def solve():
    print([1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3])
```

```python
solve()
```
