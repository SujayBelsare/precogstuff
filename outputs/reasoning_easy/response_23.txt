Okay, let's analyze the given problem and determine the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "BBEDF"
Available transitions:
1) "BBED"->"BB"
2) "BBF"->"DEC"
3) "C"->"CA"
4) "DECAA"->""

We need to transform "BBEDF" into "".

1. The string starts with "BBED". The first transition "BBED"->"BB" seems applicable and helpful since it reduces the length of the string. Let's apply it:
   "BBEDF" -> "BBF"
   [1]

2. Now we have "BBF". The second transition "BBF"->"DEC" applies. This introduces "DEC", which seems less helpful, but let's proceed and see what happens:
   "BBF" -> "DEC"
   [1, 2]

3. Now we have "DEC". We need to somehow turn this into "DECAA" to use transition 4.  We can introduce an "A" using rule 3, but only to a 'C' by "C"->"CA". So, let's add two As by using rules on the existing 'C'.
   "DEC" -> "DECA"
   [1, 2, 3]

4. Again add an "A"
   "DECA" -> "DECAA"
   [1, 2, 3, 3]

5. Now the string is "DECAA", so we apply rule 4.
   "DECAA" -> ""
   [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Therefore, the solution is:
[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]}$
