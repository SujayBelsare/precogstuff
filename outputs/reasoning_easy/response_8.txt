Let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "AFCAE" into an empty string using the given transitions:
1) "" -> "BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" -> ""

Since the only way to reach the empty string is transition 2, we must somehow transform "AFCAE" into "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". Transition 1 allows us to add "BC" at the beginning of the string as many times as needed, but only at the very start, which isn't much help.

The only available move is transition 2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->"". Thus our aim must be convert "AFCAE" to "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
Since we can only add "BC" to the BEGINNING of the string we can use the first transition zero times, and then the second transition. However, this is useless.

Now we have realized we have been tricked. The trick is that since transition 1 is ""->"BC" it CAN be applied ANYWHERE. Therefore transition 1 can be called to make "" become BC as many times as we want and anywhere we desire, until we achieve the state "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".

Therefore starting from "AFCAE", we simply need to apply transition 1 at 7 different positions until we achieve BCBCBCBCAFCAE, where we can use transition 2 to get to the empty string.

Since empty strings are inserted BEFORE the beginning, we will use the transition at the start.
"AFCAE"
""->"BC" - insert before AFCAE
"BCAFCAE"
""->"BC" - insert before BCAFCAE
"BCBCAFCAE"
""->"BC" - insert before BCBCAFCAE
"BCBCBCAFCAE"
""->"BC" - insert before BCBCBCAFCAE
"BCBCBCBCAFCAE"
""->"BC" - insert before BCBCBCBCAFCAE
"BCBCBCBCBCAFCAE"

Therefore, transition 1 needs to be called 4 more times before AFCAE.
"BCBCBCBCAFCAE" is the 3rd insertion. Therefore four more insertions is a total of 7 to reach BCBCBCBCAFCAE

"AFCAE" - initial string.

Transition 1 gives: "BCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCBCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCBCBCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCBCBCBCBCAFCAE"
Transition 1 gives: "BCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCAFCAE" <- Length = 16 = 7xBC (14 chars) + AFCAE (5 chars)
Thus we have the target state. Then transition 2 sets that to ""

The total is 7 uses of Transition 1 and one final use of Transition 2.

```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
```
Reasoning:
We start from AFCAE, which needs to transform to BCBCBCBCAFCAE to then apply Transition 2 to achieve "". Transition 1 inserts "BC" before the starting position. Thus we must insert 7 sets of "BC". Hence we apply transition 1, 7 times followed by transition 2 to reach the goal.
Therefore "[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]" is the correct result.

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
