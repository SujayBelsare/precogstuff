Okay, let's solve this sed puzzle game problem step-by-step, focusing on the rules and available transitions.

Initial string: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

Available transitions:
1) ""->"09"
2) "3C"->"F1"
3) "A5"->"2C"
4) "8"->"5FF"
5) "F1D3"->"D8"
6) "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"->""

1. "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 2 ("3C"->"F1"):
"4F1D3DA5DA0A8978"

2. "4F1D3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 5 ("F1D3"->"D8"):
"4D8DA5DA0A8978"

3. "4D8DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 3 ("A5"->"2C"):
"4D8D2CDA0A8978"

4. "4D8D2CDA0A8978"
Apply transition 4 ("8"->"5FF"):
"4D5FFD2CDA0A8975FF" (First 8 changed to "5FF")

Now this seems less promising, let's backtrack to Step 3.
3.  "4D8DA5DA0A8978"

Apply transition 4 ("8"->"5FF"):
"4D5FFDA5DA0A5FF975FF"
This looks even worse.

Back to the first alternate from Step 1:
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
3. "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 4 ("8"->"5FF"):
"43CD3DA5DA0A5FF975FF"
Yet still worse

Back to initial:
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Applying some transformation may make the long string to empty:
6) "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"->""
In initial string, we have:
4, 3C, D, A5, DA0A, 8, 978
3C->F1
A5->2C
8->5FF
Then:
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978" ->
"4F1D3D2CDA0A5FF975FF"
Still not much luck... Let's try to get that long string.

Let's carefully explore combinations.

Okay, new approach. Let's try to make some "09" appear.  Since we want to make a large target string vanish, adding a prefix to our current word "43CD3DA5DA0A8978", makes sense.

Apply transition 1) ""->"09"

"0943CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 1) ""->"09"
"090943CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 2) "3C"->"F1":
"09094F1D3DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 5) "F1D3"->"D8"

"09094D8DA5DA0A8978"
Apply transition 3) "A5"->"2C"
"09094D8D2CDA0A8978"

Apply transition 4) "8"->"5FF"
"09094D8D2CDA0A5FF975FF" ...

This approach did not lead to anything. Let's examine from a backwards perspective. 

We have a final transformation to "":
"09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"->""

We should aim to produce "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978" at some point.

Initial: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

Maybe we should reverse the list of transformation operations, i.e. apply inverse transition

Applying 1) at start gives "09", so lets leave it.

Initial string is: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978".

"43CD3DA5DA0A8978". Need: "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
Let's try focusing on "4D8D...".
Can get the 4? It stays same.
Then "3CD3" must turn into "D8D"

So we need to first transform to create the big string "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
So applying transition 1 twice.
"090943CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Then applying "3C"-> "F1":
"09094F1D3DA5DA0A8978"
"F1D3"->"D8":

"09094D8DA5DA0A8978"
"A5"->"2C":
"09094D8D2CDA0A8978"
"8"->"5FF":
"09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
Almost... "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"

Then:

43CD3DA5DA0A8978 ->
0943CD3DA5DA0A8978 ->
090943CD3DA5DA0A8978 ->
09094F1D3DA5DA0A8978 ->
09094D8DA5DA0A8978->
09094D8D2CDA0A8978->
09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978 -> "" (using tran 6.)
Transition Steps = [1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6] NOT solvable though!
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978" is our initial!

If, we can directly form string  "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978", we could use transtion 6: ""<- "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
Start -> "" needs reverse application of [tran 6]

Let's go another time

"43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
2) "3C"->"F1":
"4F1D3DA5DA0A8978"
4) "8"->"5FF":
"4F1D3DA5DA0A5FF975FF" does not leads anything.

If somehow could be directly transformed into our last operation

Okay, Final ANSWER :
