Let's analyze the initial string "DFEEFDECFDCABBA" and the available transitions to find a path to an empty string.

1) "E"->"CC"
2) "DFCCEFDE"->"BECFDAEECC"
3) "DCA"->"DC"
4) "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA"->""

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to the first "E":
"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"  [1]

Step 2: Apply transition 1 to the first "E":
"DFCCEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA" [1]

Step 3: Apply transition 1 to the first "E":
"DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCCCCDECFDCABBA" [1]

Step 4: Apply transition 2, "DFCCEFDE"->"BECFDAEECC" : This does *not* match. This is problematic and not directly helpful in reducing length, suggesting a poor initial direction. The final string in transition 4 suggest that a grouping of B, C, and D need to occur. So going from transition 1 to 2 won't get us the desirable structure.

Let's start fresh, exploring different combinations.

Initial string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to all the E's to maximize the number of C's in anticipation for using rule #4 later

"DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "DFCCCFDCCCFDCABBA"
[1,1,1,1]

Now we have, "DFCCCFDCCCFDCABBA". Let's see where we are:
Transition 2: "DFCCEFDE"->"BECFDAEECC" -> Does not seem to lead to reduction.
Transition 3: "DCA"->"DC". "DFCCCFDCCCFDCABBA". Does not occur.

Going back. Instead, try another arrangement that takes DCA into account.

DFEEFDECFDCABBA
[1] DFCCEFDECFDCABBA
Transition 2, "DFCCEFDE"->"BECFDAEECC". Let's apply it.

BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA [2]
Now use rule #1, to resolve those two "EE".

BCCFDACCCCCFDCABBA
[1,1]
Let's go back to the original and go a different direction.
Original string: "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
Turn first E into "CC".
DFCCEFDECFDCABBA
Turn next E into "CC".
DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA
Now, apply rule 2
BECFDAEECCCCCCCCABBA
Apply rule #1 again
BCCFDACCCCCCCCCCABBA
It is clear turning all the E's is not the correct approach. It explodes the size of the problem.

Going back to
DFEEFDECFDCABBA

Consider rule #3, DCA -> DC, it occurs in the input as FDC A BBA

What about targeting rule #4 directly. It ends with BBA, so that is favorable.

DFEEFDECFDCABBA

Let's think if there is a way to make "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA" appear via other rules, it seems no other rules contribute to the creation of letter 'B'. Maybe we should simply ignore the prefix letters 'DFEEFD'.

After repeated inspection and consideration, there is no simple obvious application of steps. We must consider "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA" directly. But this doesn't appear, there must be a manipulation that we are not seeing that requires clever use of DCA->DC.

Since transition 4 ends in BBA, let's start with trying to remove preceding parts by focusing on DCA -> DC

DFEEFDECFDCABBA.

What happens if all 'E' is mapped to CC first. This ends up leading to a dead end.

Let's rethink the problem. Start from the end target "", and think what transitions can reverse towards a starting configuration.

Transition #4 is most promising. What we need is a configuration like "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA". Then, how do we morph "DFEEFDECFDCABBA" -> "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA". It is definitely not trivial.
Rule 4 needs to get called LAST.
Focusing on Rule #3: DCA -> DC is promising as it helps shorten things at least when we are lost.

DFEEFDECFDCABBA
-> Rule 1 DFCCEFDECFDCABBA

Stuck. Going in circles. Re-read problem requirements carefully.

There must exist a transition route. This suggests a specific step forward exists. If no obvious strategy works, then trying each rule one at a time is needed. This process may reveal something previously missed.

From "DFEEFDECFDCABBA"
Rule 1 gives "DFCCEFDECFDCABBA"
Rule 2 gives "BECFDAEECCFDCABBA" - potentially useful to eliminate "DFCCEFDE" group
Rule 3 has no match, as DCA is missing.
Rule 4 has no match

So either step #1 or step #2 needs to happen next.
"BECFDAEECCFDCABBA" - This can create 'DCA' via the EE -> CCCC approach by expanding them. This does add more character, but creates opportunity

Following up with "BECFDAEECCFDCABBA"
Two Applications of rule 1 on 'EE'.

BECFDACCCCCFDCABBA

Now DCA appears!
BECFDCCCCCFDCABBA becomes BECFDCCCCCCDCBBA with Rule #3

Original DFEEFDECFDCABBA
[2] BECFDAEECCFDCABBA
[1, 1] BECFDACCCCCFDCABBA
[3] BECFDCCCCCCDCBBA
It almost looks right.

However let's analyze Transition 4 for other insights, maybe BBA on both sides, or even FDCBBA needs to remain to leverage.
The original has
D FEEFDECF DCA BBA
Since DCA is near the end, DCA's must occur close to end rather than upfront. What if we delay using transition #1,
Keep track, must remove all the characters DFEEFDE.
Since using rule #1 upfront leads to explosion of length without control, transition #1's can be reserved until required to create groups of 'CC'.
DFEEFDECFDCABBA
->

New strategy.
We want B CC CFDAC C ECCC FDC BBA so somehow a DCA needs to arise in original somehow. It arises from transforming EE

DFEEFDECFDCABBA

[1] to the second last "E",DFEECF DCCABBA -->

Restarting:

DFEEFDECFDCABBA -> DFEEFDCCFDCABBA
Applying (1)

Now it is clear rule 4 cannot be generated. Focus needs to eliminate
'DFEEFDE'. Only transitions available involve 'E','CC' or 'DCA'.

After another exhaustive walk through the transitions and trying various branches of expansions with the initial E transitions and looking for the rule#4 trigger "BCCCFDACCECCCFDCBBA" There's no real reduction being achieved, often blowing out into even longer combinations making them harder to handle.

DFEEFDECFDCABBA

This means some very non-trivial sequence and transformations may be hidden and subtle than initially imagined. It requires some trick probably,

[1] Apply transformation one two times for first two Es:
DFCCCCFDECFDCABBA

Consider starting from desired and working backwards and doing inverse operations, and check it out: from "": inverse
Step -1 B C C C F D A C C E C C C F D C B BA (inverse)
From Step -1 inverse DCA transformation D C A --> D C means removing DA between each consecutive DC

DFEEFDECFDCABBA
[1] apply to 2nd E:
DFEECFDECFDCABBA =/
[1,2] gives
BECFDAEECCCFDCABBA (2)

It seems we are still very lost, This question needs further thought. But one sequence is guaranteed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[]}$
There must be an error with the question setup as the output is required to be in an index form [a,b,c] - while no solution path is obvious to obtain an empty string from the provided initial state and given transitions.
