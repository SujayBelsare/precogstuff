Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step with utmost care. The initial string is "A728DB0EA3550" and the goal is to reach an empty string "".

Transitions available:
1) "3550"->"883"
2) "B0EA"->"1E"
3) "8D"->"C8"
4) "883"->"64"
5) "E6"->"C83"
6) ""->"4BD"
7) "4BDA72C81C834"->""

1. **Apply transition 1:** A728DB0EA3550 -> A728DB0EA883  (Used rule 1)

2. **Apply transition 4:** A728DB0EA883 -> A728DB0EA64 (Used rule 4)

Now the string is "A728DB0EA64".  It seems difficult to directly apply the last, most powerful, rule. Let's try to work on "A728D..." part.

It looks like the string "B0EA" from the middle could be collapsed:

3. **Apply transition 2:** A728DB0EA64 -> A728D1E64 (Used rule 2)

Now we have "A728D1E64". Notice that "E6" appears, which can be converted using transition 5:

4. **Apply transition 5:** A728D1E64 -> A728D1C834 (Used rule 5)

Now the string is "A728D1C834". We still haven't generated a recognizable prefix. It also doesn't seem immediately possible to use Rule 7 "4BDA72C81C834"->"" because of "A728D1". If only "A72" were changed somehow, we could leverage it. Transition 3 modifies a substring with "8D" in it which appears in the string "A72**8D**1C834" so

5. **Apply transition 3:** A728D1C834 -> A72C81C834 (Used rule 3)

Now the string is "A72C81C834".  It looks like we are closer. Rule 7 involves substring "A72C81C834". Before A72 there has to be the substring "4BDA". Also "4BDA72C81C834" is a substring of "A72C81C834", it needs that starting "4BDA". It means an additional step, but let's consider applying rule number 6 now:

6. **Apply transition 6:** A72C81C834 -> 4BDA72C81C834 (Used rule 6)

The string is "4BDA72C81C834".

7. **Apply transition 7:** 4BDA72C81C834 -> "" (Used rule 7)

The string is "".

The final sequence is [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7]
FINAL ANSWER: [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7]
