Okay, let's analyze the problem and derive the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "3EDC5"

Transitions:
1) "3E"->"94"
2) "4DC5"->"91"
3) "99"->"334C6"
4) ""->"EE"
5) "EE3"->"A5"
6) "1"->"4E"
7) "A534C64E"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1. "3E"->"94".
"3EDC5" -> "94DC5"

Step 2: Apply transition 2. "4DC5"->"91".
"94DC5" -> "991"

Step 3: Apply transition 3. "99"->"334C6".
"991" -> "334C61"

Step 4: Apply transition 6. "1"->"4E".
"334C61" -> "334C64E"

Now we need an 'A5' at the start of the next step for transition 7 to work, therefore some rearrangement of our numbers is necessary using transitions 1-6

Transition 5 is key here, we can use it, along with transition 1, by inserting 'EE' to produce 'A5':

Step 5: Apply transition 4. ""->"EE".
"334C64E" -> "334C64EE"

Transition 5 is key here, so somehow create EE3 from 334C64EE and apply that! But that would change our last bit of string we must remove

Notice a very subtle point, 34C6 is in transition 7. Maybe by doing the transition we did to find a way to use transition 5: "A534C64E"->"" we have our answer! If that works, lets check

Transition 7: "A534C64E"->"" needs A5 at the start
To achieve "A534C64E", try to produce "EE3" and use transition 5 to get "A5"

Step 5: insert EE (transition 4)
334C64E -> EE334C64E
apply transition 5 which turns EE3 -> A5
result -> A534C64E

Step 6:
A534C64E -> ""

Therefore the steps we performed were transitions 1,2,3,6,4,7.

Solution:
[1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7]
