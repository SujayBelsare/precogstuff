Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle.

Initial string: "FFADDAEEB"
Available transitions:
1) "B"->"FB"
2) "FADDA"->"BDC"
3) "CEEF"->"AF"
4) "FFBDAFFB"->""

1. Applying rule 1 to the final B gives us: "FFADDAEEFB"
2. Applying rule 1 to the final B gives us: "FFADDAEEFFB"
3. No other transitions can be done other than to get "FFBDA..." to utilize rule 4
4. Therefore must create FFBDAFFB

Current string: "FFADDAEEFFB"

Notice a substring "FADDA" which rule 2 works for
FFADDAEEFFB -> FFBDCEEFFB
Again looking for rule 4 application requirements "FFBDAFFB"

Now "CEEF" substring can work utilizing rule 3
FFBDCEEFFB -> FFBDCAFFB

The required form for rule 4 has been achieved. Apply rule 4 now:
FFBDCAFFB -> ""

Therefore
FFADDAEEB->FFADDAEEFB->FFADDAEEFFB->FFBDCEEFFB->FFBDCAFFB->""

Transitions are [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[1,1,2,3,4]
