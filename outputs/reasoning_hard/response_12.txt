Okay, let's tackle this Sed Puzzle. The initial string is "28381", and our goal is to reduce it to "". The available transitions are:

1) "8381"->"595"
2) "59"->"BF"
3) "F5"->"12"
4) "2B"->"52A"
5) ""->"A3"
6) "A3A352A12"->""

Let's start applying the transitions. I am considering multiple paths and keeping track of the best one:

**Step 1:** Notice we want to produce "A3A352A12". There are no available substitutions that create the entire string directly so let's break down how to best reach this string. To create a successful transition it is important to only change the first matching substring.

**Step 2:** We first attempt to make the "8381" pattern in "28381" transition 1 leads us to: "2595"
*28381 -> 2595*
`[1]`

**Step 3:** With "2595" in hand, we can apply transition 2 by applying "59"->"BF"
*2595 -> 2BF5*
`[1,2]`

**Step 4:** Now "2BF5" is more complicated but now we see "F5", which gives: "2BF5" -> "2B12"
*2595 -> 2BF5 -> 2B12*
`[1,2,3]`

**Step 5:** Let us attempt to use substitution rule 4 where "2B"->"52A" which leads to: "2B12" -> "52A12"
*2595 -> 2BF5 -> 2B12 -> 52A12*
`[1,2,3,4]`

**Step 6:** We see the "52A12" segment in our target so now lets insert "A3A3" at the beginning, so that "A3A352A12" goes to "". If we use substitution rule 5 two times we will receive A3 and A3 which lets us insert this string with substitution rule 5.
First Insertion *52A12 -> A352A12*

**Step 7:** Second insertion *A352A12 -> A3A352A12*
`[1,2,3,4,5,5]`

**Step 8:** Now apply the final Rule "A3A352A12"->""
*52A12 -> A352A12 -> A3A352A12 -> ""*
`[1,2,3,4,5,5,6]`

Thus, we have arrived at the solution.
**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]}$
