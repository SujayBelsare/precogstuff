Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "BBA23". The goal is to transform it into an empty string using the provided transitions.

Available transitions:
1) ""->"97"
2) "7BBA2"->"4F"
3) "94F"->"78"
4) "7"->"CE"
5) "9797CE83"->""

It seems clear that the target string "9797CE83" will have to be produced at some point in the transformation. Working backward from there, we can infer the steps that need to be taken.

The initial string, "BBA23", doesn't directly match any of the transition rules except possibly transition 1, which inserts "97" where there is an empty string. This appears unhelpful and is not the initial path.

We want to get to "9797CE83". We need to introduce a "7" so that Rule 4 ("7"->"CE") becomes possible.
Notice the rule "7BBA2" -> "4F". The initial string has "BBA2", but without the 7 at the beginning. The rules allow us to add content but never delete "BBA23" to reveal the transition.

Therefore we try to create it with rule number 1 "".->"97". Rule 2 "7BBA2"->"4F" looks very promising. Then rule 3 and finally rule 5 will clear.
But, our initial string is "BBA23" that has no '7' to begin with.
Aha! The given rules state the existence of the empty string. This allows us to add leading prefixes.

Let's attempt the following sequence:
1. Insert "97" at the beginning ""->"97". Now the string becomes "97BBA23".
2.  Insert "97" at the beginning "".->"97". Now the string becomes "9797BBA23".
We need a lonely 7 so it can change to "CE" for rule number 5.
3. The critical move - let's try rule 2. The string begins with '97BBA2'. We will replace '7BBA2' -> '4F'. The result will be "94F3".
4. Apply rule 3 "94F" -> "78" to yield "783"
5. Now we need to have a lonely "7" appear so we can change to CE.
6. Insert "97" at the beginning ""->"97". Now the string becomes "97783".
7. Apply rule 4: replace 7->"CE" and we get "9CE83"
8. We need 97, which can be gained via applying rule 1, which is ""->"97". Not great.
9. Apply rule 1 again, to make string "9797CE83"
10. String cleared. Apply rule 5: "9797CE83"->""

This makes the transition sequence [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]

Let's rethink to make it shorter:

1. Insert "97" at the beginning ""->"97". Now the string becomes "97BBA23".
2. Apply rule 2. The string begins with '97BBA2'. We will replace '7BBA2' -> '4F'. The result will be "94F3".
3. Apply rule 3 "94F" -> "78" to yield "783"
4. Apply rule 4: replace 7->"CE" and we get "CE83"
5. Insert "97" at the beginning ""->"97". Now the string becomes "97CE83".
6. Insert "97" at the beginning ""->"97". Now the string becomes "9797CE83".
7. String cleared. Apply rule 5: "9797CE83"->""
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 5]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 5]}$
