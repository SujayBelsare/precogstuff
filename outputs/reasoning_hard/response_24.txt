Let's analyze the given transitions and initial string "A568648" to find a sequence that leads to an empty string.

Initial String: A568648

1. Apply transition 2: "A56"->"84D"
   A568648 -> 84D8648

2. Apply transition 3: "84D"->"E7"
   84D8648 -> E78648

3. We are trying to get a string matching rule 7 which needs an "F2B0E27". So far we have "E7" in our current string. Let's proceed carefully to build up this specific string. Apply transition 1: "48"->"F7"
   E78648 -> E786F7
   Currently have 'E7', need to transform the remaining '86F7' to 'F2B0E27', i.e., transform the "86" portion somehow. Need to look ahead and consider what produces "B0E2". Rule 5 transforms "8F4783" to "B0E2".

4. We can turn the "F" to "F2". Apply transition 6: "F"->"F2".
    E786F7 -> E786F27

5. Looks like rule 7 might be usable but let's build "8F4783" first, starting with the current E786F27. Apply transition 4 "E786F"->"F8F4783". So let's modify this string. We will remove 'F2', replace 'F' to 'F', meaning no change from 6.
Consider Rule 4 closely and how it could assist. Currently the string is E786F27. The pattern match for transition 4 "E786F"->"F8F4783". Note only a substring transform. Not removal or addition.

6. We will try using the transform rule 4 'E786F'-->'F8F4783'. Therefore E786F27->F8F478327

7. The next step is now use transition 5 on it '8F4783'-->'B0E2' . F8F478327->FB0E227

8. Since rule 6 can introduce 'F2', transform the existing F -> F2, FB0E227->F2B0E227

9. The last thing we need is '7', and currently we have '27', thus try to eliminate '2'
If something changes something to 7 we would need that.
Reconsidering.
Original chain:
A568648
2 -> 84D8648
3 -> E78648
1 -> E786F7
6 -> E786F27
...

Another Approach from A568648:
A568648 -- (2) --> 84D8648
84D8648 -- (3) --> E78648
E78648 requires use of rule 4 to give F8F4783, so convert '48' with rule 1 to get "F7", so E78648 => E786F7 -- (6)-> E786F27, at this moment string length isn't good and can't use rule 4 and string does not contain 'F'.
Re-evaluating: Rule 7 has to be the very end step: F2B0E27 -> ""

A568648
2. A56 -> 84D : 84D8648
3. 84D -> E7 : E78648
1. 48 -> F7: E786F7
6. F -> F2: E786F27
What we need is 'B0E2', which we can get from applying rule 5 in reverse on A568648 to E78648: rule (4), therefore: applying transition rule (4) from E786F is to insert 8F4783. So convert E786F27 via rule 6: to obtain the correct order for application of rule 4:
The sequence E786F27 means convert through using (4) E786F ->F8F4783.
If E786F is convert into  F8F4783. Convert rule: (2), (3), (1) and (6):  convert into the following transitions
Using  1: 'A56' => '84D', then '84D' => 'E7' using rule 3, lastly find how we are getting F : the order need to shift. Consider '48' with the value'F7'. From 7 requires 'F2B0E27'. Try shifting : '48' using rule '1'. This yields 2, 3, 1 then 86 with conversion is to insert it via rule (4).

"A568648"
1.  A56 -> "84D" "84D8648" (rule 2)
2.  84D -> "E7" "E78648" (rule 3)
3. "48" -> "F7" "E786F7" (rule 1)
4.  "F7" -> "F27": doesn't work.

Restarting with the observation that 'F2B0E27' needs to appear just before the empty string, and we have 'F2', 'B0E2', '7'.
So let us focus on rule 5:'8F4783'->'B0E2'. Which has to appear right before transition rule 7.

Here is the solution path:
1. A56 -> 84D, creating "84D8648"  [Rule 2]
2. 84D -> E7, creating "E78648" [Rule 3]
3. 48 -> F7, creating "E786F7" [Rule 1]
4. Apply transition 4 'E786F'->'F8F4783'. E786F7 becomes F8F47837 [Rule 4]
5. 8F4783 -> B0E2 creating FB0E27 [Rule 5]
6. F -> F2 creating F2B0E27 [Rule 6]
7. F2B0E27 -> "" [Rule 7]
[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output:
[2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
