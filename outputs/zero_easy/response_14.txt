Okay, let's play the Sed Puzzle Game. My objective is to transform the initial string "ADDFD" into an empty string "" using the given transitions, while rigorously reasoning through each step. Incorrect answers lead to termination, so I will proceed with extreme caution.

Here's the list of transitions available:
1) "DFD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"BE"
3) "ADFBBBE"->""

Initial String: "ADDFD"

**Step 1:** Apply transition 1 "DFD"->"FE" to the initial string "ADDFD". The first "DFD" is in the string at index 2.
Result: "ADFE"

**Step 2:** No transition seems to be directly applicable. Let's apply transition 2 "E"->"BE".
Result: "ADFBE"

**Step 3:** Now, no rule applies directly so again we apply rule 2. "E"->"BE". We apply it on "ADFBE" so it gives "ADFBBBE". Now, rule 3 is perfect for use!
Result: "ADFBBBE"

**Step 4:** Apply transition 3 "ADFBBBE"->""
Result: ""

The series of transitions used is: 1, 2, 3
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3]}$
