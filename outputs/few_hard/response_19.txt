Okay, let's solve this puzzle. The initial string is "DDC31FC" and the goal is to transform it to "". Here are the available transitions:

1) "C31FC"->"EA27C"
2) "DEA2"->"1DA"
3) ""->"5B9"
4) "C"->"00"
5) "5B"->"7E"
6) "7E95B9D1DA700"->""

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **DDC31FC** -> **DDEA27C** (Apply transition 1 to "C31FC")
2. **DDEA27C** -> **D1DA7C** (Apply transition 2 to "DEA2")
3. **D1DA7C** -> **D1DA700** (Apply transition 4 to "C")
4. Because there's no transition applicable other than 3 on an empty string, we must assume that we'll only apply transtition 6.

Therefore, we can determine that transition 6 is an amalgamation of multiple transitions.

We must work to ensure this transition can eventually take place.
The transition can occur if and only if the string matches to "7E95B9D1DA700".

We are currently at string "D1DA700".

The transitions required now, in reverse, are:
"7E95B9D1DA700"->""
"5B"->"7E"
""->"5B9"
"C"->"00"
"DEA2"->"1DA"
"C31FC"->"EA27C"

5. **D1DA700** -> **7E95B9D1DA700** (apply transtition 5 reverse "5B"->"7E", in reverse direction to get from 7E to 5B. Notice 7->7 and E to 5B has never been possible)
It appears we are now stuck since this transitions only works on "". Instead, consider this

1. **DDC31FC** -> **DDEA27C** (Apply transition 1 to "C31FC")
2. **DDEA27C** -> **D1DA7C** (Apply transition 2 to "DEA2")
3. **D1DA7C** -> **D1DA700** (Apply transition 4 to "C")
Now consider if we instead added "5B9"
4. **D1DA700** -> **5B9** Transition is unavailable

However we have a transition of ""->"5B9". Lets remove "D1DA700" and work backwards. "7E9" exists in Transition 6.

Reconsider the problem

1. **DDC31FC** -> **DDEA27C** (Apply transition 1 to "C31FC")
2. **DDEA27C** -> **D1DA7C** (Apply transition 2 to "DEA2")
3. **D1DA7C** -> **D1DA700** (Apply transition 4 to "C")
Apply ""->"5B9" somewhere. Let's work this from transition 6 backwards. Since transition 6 removes string, then "" must be appended. Append by setting "". It can be appended at front or end.

4.  **D1DA700** -> **D1DA7005B9** Apply Transition 3 to "". Appending at the end to prepare 7E9.
Now, the end section is 005B9->7E95B9 which needs to transform into "7E9" by removing 5B. Transition 5 changes 5B to 7E so remove works

5. **D1DA7005B9** -> **D1DA7007E9** Apply Transition 5

Now, the final string is 7E95B9D1DA700 so can potentially remove all. Lets put final letters back

6.   **D1DA7007E9** -> **7E95B9D1DA700** (apply transtition 5 reverse to place original value"5B" rather than"7E". However there is no transition in that direction ) It appearss we were incorrect. 

The first thing to look at is transition 6 which is the only transition available for us to use once we modify strings and will remove everything. Lets dissect transition 6

7E95B9D1DA700
7E
5B->7E (TRANSITION 5)
9
5B->7E (TRANSITION 5)
9
D1DA
7
00 ->C( TRANSITION 4, INVERTED)

We are trying to achieve the same result. 
Transition 4: "C"->"00" . Since 00 is near the end , make string such the end value will transition to 'c'
Therefore a sequence of transformation of end value is: .... C (Transform via 4) ... 00, with 00 at the tail.

Therefore the key steps we need for a successsful procedure, that will transition from DDC31FC to "", 
is finding what we have common with 7E95B9D1DA700, such that we can use transitions 1-5 to slowly transform towards it. The D1DA looks like a promising part
1. DDC31FC -> 1: DDEA27C, 2 DEA2 (Apply transition 1)
2. DDEA27C -> D1DA7C, 3 Apply transition 2 to get DEA2
3. D1DA7C  -> D1DA700 Applying trans 4

To transform into transition 6, D1DA is already there in correct spot (4 characters from start ) and we need "7E95B9......" preceding this and ""  afterwards

4. The transitions may need some sort of loop (a-z->a) and if it needs looping then it becomes unprovable,

So back to beginning. What letter should change first

Output:
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6]
