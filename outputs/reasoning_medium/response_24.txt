Okay, let's analyze the problem and determine the sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "ECBEFABAED"

Available transitions:
1) "ECBEF"->"EBEB"
2) "ED"->"FF"
3) "ABA"->"CF"
4) "EB"->"AB"
5) "ABABCFFF"->""

Let's try applying the rules and see what happens.
ECBEFABAED

1. Apply rule 1 "ECBEF"->"EBEB": EBEBABAED

2. Apply rule 3 "ABA"->"CF": EBEBCFED

3. Apply rule 2 "ED"->"FF": EBEBCFFF

Now, we need to get from "EBEBCFFF" to "ABABCFFF" to trigger rule 5. So, try to transform "EBEB" to "ABAB"

4. Apply rule 4 "EB"->"AB": ABABBCFFF. Almost there. Need another "AB" from "EB". But there are no "EB"

Let's restart

Initial string: "ECBEFABAED"
1) "ECBEF"->"EBEB"
2) "ED"->"FF"
3) "ABA"->"CF"
4) "EB"->"AB"
5) "ABABCFFF"->""

1.  Apply rule 1 "ECBEF"->"EBEB": EBEBABAED
2. Apply rule 3 "ABA"->"CF": EBEBCFED
3. Apply rule 2 "ED"->"FF": EBEBCFFF
Now use rule 4:
4. Apply rule 4 "EB"->"AB": ABABCFFF

Now we have the target!

5. Apply rule 5 "ABABCFFF"->"": ""

Solution: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]

Reasoning:
1. 'ECBEFABAED' -> 'EBEBABAED' using rule 1.  This aims to remove the 'C' early and prepares the left side of the string.
2. 'EBEBABAED' -> 'EBEBCFED' using rule 3. This removes the 'ABA' and inserts a 'CF'. We aim to reduce it down by applying "ABABCFFF" rule.
3. 'EBEBCFED' -> 'EBEBCFFF' using rule 2. Here 'ED' got removed. We continue approaching to "ABABCFFF" goal string.
4. 'EBEBCFFF' -> 'ABABCFFF' using rule 4. Apply on 'EB'.
5. 'ABABCFFF' -> '' using rule 5. The string gets reduced to empty string.
