Okay, let's analyze the problem meticulously.

Available transitions:
1) "EE"->"FE"
2) "FED"->"EAC"
3) ""->"CE"
4) "DF"->"AB"
5) "CEABFAEAC"->""

Initial string: "FAEED"

Goal: "" (empty string)

The target string for the final transition is "CEABFAEAC". Let's see how we can maneuver the initial string towards this state.

1. **FAEED** ->  **FAFED** (applying rule 1 "EE"->"FE")

Now we have "FAFED". We need "EAC" to form within the substring.  Let's try to create that next, targeting transition 2

2.  **FAFED** -> FAEAC (transition 2, FED-> EAC )
 Now our string looks close!

The transition 5 needs CEABFAEAC to go to "". So let's see how close the string 'FAEAC' looks with the one that can collapse into nothing.

We can insert CEAB. Let's check to see how AB appears

We have:
F - keep the character
AEAC

Lets make AB with DF -> AB (rule 4)

Therefore we have:
FAEAC
Need to transform F into DF

The transition DF does not apply, it has to come AFTER so there must be a way to form FA. So F -> DF? NO so Rule 4 doesnt apply.

Let's restart with FAEED to think with rule 4 as a priority

Let's convert EED -> FED with Rule 1 twice. 
1) FAEED -> FAFED (Rule 1)
2) FAFED -> FAFFED

There isn't a DFA in our solution path... maybe consider inserting some characters.

Transition 3: ""->"CE" , but cannot be use in nonempty string

Let's revisit. The string FAEED can be thought with rule 2: "FED"->"EAC".
Currently we don't have FED

FAEED -> FEAED -> FA E ED-> FA FE D, we are simply delaying!

Okay.
Let's observe that CEABFAEAC is very long, let's see backwards
""<- CEABFAEAC

The most important thing we can have now is Rule 5's: "CEABFAEAC"->""

Looking at Initial string: FAEED

To form Rule 5, we need CEAB before the string.

""->"CE" won't change a preexisting string. 
The best option will involve transforming FAEED to something with BFAEAC, in this case the AB comes AFTER the F. Let's look at some insertions.

There has to be a step where 'DF' is available, thus AB appears.

From "FAEED"

Try the transitions
1) "EE"->"FE"
2) "FED"->"EAC"
3) ""->"CE"
4) "DF"->"AB"
5) "CEABFAEAC"->""

FAEED -> FAFED (1)
Now we need to get DF out of FA somehow

FAEED -> transform into CAE first

let's create the BFA part of the problem: ABF
DF -> AB Rule 4! So we want DF somehow

Let me try this one more time
"FAEED"->"FAFEd"(rule 1)

now if we use rule 2:"FED"->"EAC"
then we get "FAEAC"
Missing CE and BFA now

So...

FAEED (Start)
->FAFED (rule 1)
->FAEAC (rule 2)

Let's insert CE
FAFEAC

then we require DF -> AB to come into the string...
so

Try adding a "DF" string by adding Rule 4
It seems it should be impossible to create AB first then remove it at the end

However, a more elegant solution should exist

FAEED
Applying reverse engineering

"CEABFAEAC"<-"" Rule 5

FAEED-> we can try adding a DFA to our existing function

Then with (1), (2), and (3). CE cannot be removed

Let me see the sequence again. It starts with CE.
We see EED has EE, the problem might come when EE transform to FE, maybe
So our sequence would be something:
1,2,3,4,5

However if i see (4), then "DF" should be formed first.

Answer: Impossible
Reasoning: The algorithm did not provide a solution

Let's assume Rule 3 applies ONLY to initial string. "" to CE is just dead, which isn't

Therefore we have
FAILED

Another try,
* FAEED - start
* FAFED (1 EE->FE)

If there is a "CE" + string, there may be "CE" insertion that cancels out eachother.
Because FAEED contains "AEED" this means we must focus more to F and D.

Final Approach, Rule 5 ends in EAC: We create a situation to transition towards EED by something
Here FAEED may need F and D transformation,

* FAEED --> rule 4 somehow creates a loop? Or maybe 1 then 4 should happen.

Final Answer: Impossible
Reasoning: after further attempts to look at edge cases, no valid answer

```
Impossible
