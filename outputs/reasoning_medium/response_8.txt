Okay, let's tackle this Sed Puzzle Game problem with the available transitions and the initial string "FFADDAEEB".

Available transitions:
1) "B"->"FB"
2) "FADDA"->"BDC"
3) "CEEF"->"AF"
4) "FFBDAFFB"->""

Initial string: "FFADDAEEB"

Here's the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:

1. **Analyze the Target**: The goal is to reach "" using the provided transitions. Transition 4, "FFBDAFFB"->"" is obviously crucial for the final step, which means we need to somehow create the substring "FFBDAFFB".

2. **Strategic Expansion**: Start by looking at the initial string, "FFADDAEEB". Because rule 4 is important, try to produce the sequence "FFBDAFFB". Observe the final character is 'B', and available transformations indicate that 'B' will need to be altered through rule 1, "B"->"FB".

3. **Application of B expansion rule.** Rule 1 can be applied "B"->"FB", therefore "FFADDAEEB"->"FFADDAEEFB".

4. **Trying the next Rule Application**: Now, can you think through a rule we can utilize to produce the required result. We notice "FADDA" exists and the next applicable rule is "FADDA"->"BDC". The string "FFADDAEEFB"->"FFBDCEEFB".

5. **Trying the next Rule Application**: Note now "CEEF"->"AF", so therefore, the string "FFBDCEEFB"->"FFBDAFB".

6. **Strategic Expansion Continued:** Rule 1 will now be applied on "FFBDAFB", in order to prep it for the final transformation: FFBDAFB -> FFBDAFFB

7. **Final Step**: Apply rule 4 on "FFBDAFFB", resulting to "". Therefore  FFBDAFFB -> "".

The sequence of transitions applied are:

[1, 2, 3, 1, 4]

Reasoning Summary:

The solution involves strategically applying transition 1 "B"->"FB" to prepare "B", while transitions 2 "FADDA"->"BDC", and transition 3 "CEEF"->"AF" gradually shape the string to match the pattern required by the final transition 4 "FFBDAFFB"->"", leading to an empty string. The specific sequence avoids getting trapped in irreversible states and efficiently utilizes the transformation to construct a precise match for complete elimination.
FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 1, 4]
