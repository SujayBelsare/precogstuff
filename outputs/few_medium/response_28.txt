Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game problem with initial string "ABEBC" and the following transitions:

1) "EBC"->"CCA"
2) "C"->"FD"
3) "ABFD"->"FC"
4) "FFDFDA"->""

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **ABEBC -> ACCA (Transition 1: "EBC"->"CCA")**
   The first occurrence of "EBC" in "ABEBC" is replaced with "CCA", resulting in "ACCA".

2. **ACCA -> AFDA (Transition 2: "C"->"FD")**
The first "C" in "ACCA" is replaced with "FD", resulting in "AFDA".

3. **AFDA -> AFFDDA (Transition 2: "C"->"FD")**
Since there are no more instances of "EBC", use Transition 2 (C -> FD) on our original string. We had to make sure there are no additional transformation available before modifying a string to our advantage: Transition 2 (C -> FD). The first "C" in the updated result of "ACCA" is replace "FD", "AFDA"

4. **AFDA->FC (Transition 3: "ABFD"->"FC")**
Ohh man. I did transition 3 wrongly. Reverting!
Go back to stage: ACCA
To fix problem that we might not able to transfer since AFD does not fit:

2.  **ACCA -> AFDCA (Transition 2: "C"->"FD")**
   Since "EBC" are not shown anymore, so the next plan might be apply transformation on "C" to get rid of strings. Use transion 2 again.

3.  **AFDCA->AFFDDA (Transition 2: "C"->"FD")**
Apply transion 2 ( C to FD ).

4.  **AFFDDA->"" (Transition 4: "FFDFDA"->"")**
Apply transion 4, finally achieve it.
Therefore the list should be:

[1,2,2,4]

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 2, 4]
