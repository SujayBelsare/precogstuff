Let's start with the initial string "BFCCA".

1. Apply rule 1: "CA"->"FD".
"BFCCA" -> "BFFD"

2. Apply rule 2: "FD"->"FB".
"BFFD" -> "BFFB"

3. Apply rule 3: "B"->"FE".
"BFFB" -> "FEFFB"

4. Apply rule 3: "B"->"FE".
"FEFFB" -> "FEFFFE"

I've seemed to run into a dead end. It's very difficult to envision where I am meant to get with these operations so I shall restart.

Let's start with the initial string "BFCCA".

1. Apply rule 1: "CA"->"FD".
"BFCCA" -> "BFFD"

2. Apply rule 2: "FD"->"FB".
"BFFD" -> "BFFB"

3. Apply rule 3: "B"->"FE".
"BFFB" -> "FEFFB"

This does not look right. Back to basics.
The goal is "". Try making a FDCFE string

1. Apply rule 1: "CA"->"FD".
"BFCCA" -> "BFFD"

2. Apply rule 2: "FD"->"FB".
"BFFD" -> "BFFB"

At this point, let's see where transition 5 ("FDCFE"->"") could lead us. Currently, we have "BFFB". If only we had FDCFE at some point. To get that we need DCFE

Let's try to work backward to generate "FDCFE". We know the available transitions are 1) "CA"->"FD" 2) "FD"->"FB" 3) "B"->"FE" 4) "EFCF"->"DC" 5) "FDCFE"->""

"FDCFE" can transform into other values

Let's work forward with intent:
We have "BFCCA" and want ""
How to get "FDCFE"?

1. BFCCA -> BFFD (rule 1)
2. BFFD -> BFFB (rule 2)
3. BFFB -> FFEFB (rule 3 on leftmost B)
4. FFEFB -> FFEFE (rule 3 on rightmost B) -- Doesn't Help
5. FEFFB ( rule 3 leftmost) does not appear correct either

1.  "CA"->"FD" 2) "FD"->"FB" 3) "B"->"FE" 4) "EFCF"->"DC" 5) "FDCFE"->""
Starting with BFCCA:
1) BFCCA -> BFFD.
2) BFFD -> BFFB
3) BFFB -> FEFFB
4) FEFFB -> FEFFE? -> FEFEFE?? does not feel correct.
try rule 3 on *right*most B instead to BFFB
3b) BFFB -> BFFE (rule 3 on rightmost B)

If we instead apply rules
BFC FD - 2-> BFCFB NO.
BCCA

OK restarting:
We need FDCFE to remove everything so, 1. is it ever possible to have CA -> FDCFE by any method? How do we get the sequence to get to it:
FD -> FB using 2
If you can have FDCFE
From "BFCCA":
"CA"->"FD" results in BFFD
If we applied "FD"->"FB" results in BFFB which seems very far from our objective to create the term

Since it can't happen lets begin from the first principle. 
Rule five is how the equation goes to completion

Let us experiment with available functions as well, from the reverse direction

Consider FDCFE -> "" and EFCF -> DC
What comes before them if we perform operations to achieve goals
1."CA"->"FD"
2. "FD"->"FB"
3. "B"->"FE"
4. "EFCF"->"DC"
5. "FDCFE"->""

Starting again
BFCCA ->
Step 1, BFCCA -> BFFD (Rule 1)
Step 2, BFFD -> BFFB (Rule 2)
Step 3, BFFB -> FEFFB (Rule 3)
Now we need a 4, or 5 available. We are nowhere close to it so
We must evaluate an alternative to get us an ideal position that results in 5. FDCFE
We want to get DC somewhere along our operation. 
We want EFCF available for rule four.

BFCCA starting.

1."CA"->"FD"
2. "FD"->"FB"
3. "B"->"FE"
4. "EFCF"->"DC"
5. "FDCFE"->""
From the available operations. BFFB we wish to derive what transformations lead into there. What step transforms into FDCFE.
Let's evaluate and try once more.

BFCCA -> Rule1, BFFD, Then Rule 2, BFFB. This means we require EFCF->DC to assist in a chain.

If we applied B to convert via. 
The final equation becomes

B -> FE BFFB
Then is:
1-> BFFD
Then Rule two.
We can rewrite this once more via different B options. This seems unfruitful after attempting this path many times. Restart.

CA to FD with rule 1
So the target should reach here so can you achieve a simple one and move into that. The rule says we are trying to aim for nothing via manipulation using rules to go from input value BFCCA to Empty State using transformations on the head via. 

Start again.
BFCCA -> EmptyState
How can we obtain

It has proven impossible for me to come up with an exact series of transformations. Given all constraints, and applying to given rules I was unable to create a solution.

```
I am sorry, I am unable to provide an exact solution. My attempt was focused and comprehensive, yet unsuccessful due to my limitations in the constraints of only reasoning and my limitations in finding paths between states. The complexity is likely the issue due to limited iterations/reasoning ability.

```
