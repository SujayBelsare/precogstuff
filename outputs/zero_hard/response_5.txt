Okay, I understand the Sed Puzzle Game rules. I will analyze the initial string and available transitions to find the optimal path to an empty string. My life depends on it!

Initial string: "6B128"

1.  "6B1" -> "6BC6" (transition 1: "1"->"C6")
    String: "6BC628"

2.  "6BC62" -> "6BC659" (transition 2: "2"->"59")
    String: "6BC6598"

3.  "" -> "4F" (transition 3: ""->"4F") Not applicable since we aren't trying to add "4F".

4. "4F6BC6BBB598"->"" Not applicable since we do not have "4F6BC6BBB598".

We now have the string "6BC6598". Notice that there are no directly applicable rules.
However, "6B128" -> "6BC628" using (1) "1"->"C6"
And "6BC628" -> "6BC6598" using (2) "2"->"59"

"6BC6598" does not appear directly as a prefix or substring to remove or apply a transform to create "4F6BC6BBB598".

Let us reconsider a solution to a different initial string "12".
(1) "1" -> "C6"
-> C62
(2) "2" -> "59"
-> C659
No applicable rules now.

Trying again.
If the starting string were "4F6BC6BBB598", we could apply transition 4 and the result is "".
Since we have "6B128", let's create this through (1)(2).
(1) applies and turns into 6BC628.
(2) applies and turns into 6BC6598.
We can append the string 4F and remove by transition 4 to empty the string, or append enough to be similar and empty the string. Since appending by 3 is only to the beginning, let's analyze other strategies before appending anything. It could be fruitless.
Since we can only apply transition 4: "4F6BC6BBB598"->"", it should probably be our guiding light to create "4F6BC6BBB598" from "6B128" or a substring containing "6B128". But this substring should also be able to be turned to this form by applying only (1)(2)(3).

The last number is "8". Notice the ending of rule (4): "...598". Then by some reverse engineering we get that the "12" must have created that "59" tail. And "1" must create that 'C6' right? Hmm. "6BC6BBB598" after taking care of '4F' through rule (3), that is the goal. We may require the insertion of a bunch of B to achieve that goal.

Let's backtrack.
1) Convert "1"->"C6": "6B128" -> "6BC628"
2) Convert "2"->"59": "6BC628" -> "6BC6598"
We are currently stuck with "6BC6598" with transition (1)(2). So, if "6BC6598" somehow can generate "4F6BC6BBB598", then transition (4) should be applicable and the problem would be solved. However, without appending rule (3) beforehand, this path seems unfruitful. Let us check a few times for anything overlooked.
1) 2 -> 59
"6B128" becomes "6B1598" . . . Doesn't seem beneficial. The other number "1" only makes the substring even longer and seems counter intuitive. "BBB" doesn't come out directly anywhere...

Alright! It's transition (4) to ""; it seems more efficient to first apply transisiton 3 at some point to create "4F...", rather than trying to directly convert to "4F6BC6BBB598" from our intermediate string.
Okay... It is a game of deduction and patience.

Okay, final answer is:

1.  Apply transition 3: ""->"4F". String becomes "4F6B128".
2. Apply transition 1: "1"->"C6": "4F6BC628".
3. Apply transition 2: "2"->"59": "4F6BC6598".
We want "4F6BC6BBB598" - let us apply transition 3 multiple times such that it fills those "B" values!

Okay... since the initial state is "6B128" without anything, let's solve for it such that transition (3) must be inserted FIRST, due to "4F" being inserted in the very first of transition(4)'s string prefix to erase into empty string:

1. Apply transition 3. "". Then "4F6B128". (3) ""->"4F"
Now how do we change into "4F6BC6BBB598" using (1)(2)(3)? Okay!
2. Apply transition 1 to the above: "1"->"C6". "4F6BC628"
3. Apply transition 2 to the above: "2"->"59". "4F6BC6598"

We need those "BBB" after 'C6', so without a rule to inject those values there, is there another insertion we can make via "" (3). It seems like injecting after B via (3) causes chaos that never terminates to final transition (4), since the final required structure must begin via "4F", which our string doesn't match. So transition (4) would never apply.
So the goal should be how can our current string resemble '4F6BC6BBB598', such that (4) should result into "" empty string. We are looking at some way for an insertion of "BBB" right there. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't allow such pattern! We are stuck again..
However, what if we have extra "B" values instead of short? Hmm

The only way to create "BBB" between "C6" and "598" from our current string "6BC6598" is only if:
"" can contain "BBB".

Therefore, final structure can only contain the following: "4F6BC6BBB598". Since only rule 3 allows appending, the solution should start via ""->'4F':

1.  Apply transition 3. Then the string is "4F6B128"
2.  Apply transition 1. "4F6BC628"
3.  Apply transition 2. "4F6BC6598"

"BBB" must be somewhere and created... but this doesn't work.
The string can not reach it's goal. This is because there is a typo in your instructions, and it is unsolvable as such due to "BBB".

Final Answer: "Unsolvable".
