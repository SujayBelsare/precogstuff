Okay, I understand. The goal is to transform "9E3368D" into "" using the provided transitions. I need to be very careful and reason through each step to avoid errors. Let's begin.

Initial string: "9E3368D"

1. **Transition 2: "8"->"25"**
   Applying transition 2 to "9E3368D" results in "9E33625D"

2. **Transition 1: "33"->"DA"**
   Applying transition 1 to "9E33625D" results in "9EDA625D"

3. **Transition 3: "A62"->"59C7"**
   Applying transition 3 to "9EDA625D" results in "9ED59C75D"

4. **Transition 4: "ED5"->"E7"**
   Applying transition 4 to "9ED59C75D" results in "9E79C75D"

5. **Transition 5: "E79"->"3D"**
    Applying transition 5 to "9E79C75D" results in "93DC75D"

6. **Transition 6: "DC7"->"1B"**
   Applying transition 6 to "93DC75D" results in "931B5D"

7. **Transition 7: "931B5D"->""**
   Applying transition 7 to "931B5D" results in ""

Therefore, the sequence of transitions is: 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
