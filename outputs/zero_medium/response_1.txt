Okay, I understand. I will meticulously apply the transitions to transform "DBFFA" into an empty string, using only the given transitions and following the rules exactly. My response will be a numbered list of the applied transitions.
Let's begin.

Initial string: "DBFFA"

1.  Apply transition 1: "DBFF" -> "DFF". The string becomes "DFFA".

2.  No transitions seem applicable. Apply transition 2 to insert "EF". It will not solve the problem. Let's try and manipulate the string to apply transition 3.

Looking back, notice that after transition 1:
Initial string: "DFFA"

If we could turn "DFFA" into "EFEFEFEFDFFA", we could apply transtion 3. This is clearly impossible with transitions 1 and 2. The transition to empty string seems to exist only with pattern "EFEFEFEFDFFA". Let's analyze other possible combinations that might lead to applying transition 3. Note that transitions must be applicable in one direction only.

Back to Initial string: "DBFFA"

Let's see if inserting "EF" right at the beginning might make the DBFF pattern happen more times.
Apply transition 2: "" -> "EF".  String becomes: "EFDBFFA"
This doesn't seem to help much.
Apply transition 1: "DBFF" -> "DFF". String becomes: "DFFEFDA"

Let's analyze backwards what needs to happen: we want the string to eventually be
"EFEFEFEFDFFA"
before becoming ""
Let's think backwards. Where did "EFEFEFEFDFFA" come from? Is there anything + valid transition that would take us to this string?

Back to the initial "DBFFA"

What can transition 1 and 2 really *do* to this string to help us? We can see that DFF exists in both the Initial string and the end goal (though surrounded by "EF"). Since transition 1 turns "DBFF" -> "DFF", we can see that our string contains "DBFF". Thus:

1. Apply transition 1: "DBFF" -> "DFF". "DBFFA" becomes "DFFA".

Now we are at "DFFA". We want to create something that looks like "EFEFEFEFDFFA"

Unfortunately, no transitions are applicable and no approach seems viable. I was too confident. This means the transitions as listed above might be WRONG! Or the question contains a red herring and the transition to a empty string looks completely different. Since I have to stick to these three rules. It is impossible.

Final Answer: The provided problem is impossible to solve with the provided transitions.

Termination.
