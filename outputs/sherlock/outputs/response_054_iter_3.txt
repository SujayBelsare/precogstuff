Okay, let's map the game states and look for a repeatable pattern.
The target string is "CBCDDEFFADAEA".

1. "CCCBDF" -> "ADBAEA" (Transition 1)

Now we have "ADBAEA".
We want to get to "CBCDDEFFADAEA".

Let's try applying rule 3 to all As.
"ADBAEA" -> "DDBDDBDDEEDD"

Let's try applying rule 4 to AD.
"ADBAEA" -> "EFFBAEA"

Let's analyze the target string.
"CBCDDEFFADAEA"

We have the transition "" -> "CB".
We also have "CBCDDEFFADAEA" -> "".

Let's think about working backwards.
We need to create "CBCDDEFFADAEA".

"CCCBDF" -> "ADBAEA" (Transition 1)

Let's try the following sequence.

1. CCCBDF -> ADBAEA (1)
2. ADBAEA -> EFFBAEA (4)
Now we have EFFBAEA.

Let's call JW again.

JW HELP!
