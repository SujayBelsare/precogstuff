Okay, let's analyze the problem. We have the following transitions:

1) "FD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"DC"
3) "FAFDCCFE"->""

Initial string: "FAFEFD"

We want to transform "FAFEFD" to "". Let's try applying the rules systematically.

FAFEFD -> applying rule 1 is not possible as FD is only at the end
FAFEFD -> applying rule 2 is possible "FAFEFD" -> "FADCFEFD"
FAFEFD -> applying rule 3 is not possible

Let's try applying rule 1 first. It seems like we need to have "FD" sequence.

FAFEFD -> applying rule 1 is not possible
Let's try to make "FAFDCCFE". We can't.

FAFEFD. Let's analyze the target string. It has "FA...FD...CCFE".
We have "FA...FEFD".
Let's try rule 1:
FAFEFD -> No match

Let's apply rule 2 to the Es.
FAFEFD -> FADCFEFD
FADCFEFD -> No matches

Let's consider the target: FAFDCCFE -> ""

If we could turn FAFEFD to FAFDCCFE, we can solve the problem.
We need to turn E -> D and FD -> CCFE

Let's try a different approach.

FAFEFD
Apply rule 2 to E:
FADCFEFD
No matches

Let's try to create an FD next to FA:
FAFEFD -> No.
Let's try to create FAFDCCFE in steps.

FAFEFD
We want to get FAFDCCFE
We already have FA...FD
So we want to transform EF -> CCFE
E -> DC. So we want to transform DCF -> CCFE

Let's try applying rule 1 to get FE:
FAFEFD -> No match.

Let's apply rule 2 to the E's:
FAFEFD -> FADCFEFD

Let's try a different approach.
We need to transform FAFEFD to FAFDCCFE
FAFEFD
1) FD -> FE
2) E -> DC
3) FAFDCCFE -> ""

Let's try to get FAFDCCFE
FAFEFD -> we need to make FD and CCFE.
We have FEFD. If we apply 2, we have FADCFEFD.

FAFEFD
We want to get to FAFDCCFE
We have FAFEFD
We need to change the Es to get to D and CCFE.

Let's try a breadth-first search approach.

FAFEFD
Rule 1: No
Rule 2: FADCFEFD

FADCFEFD
Rule 1: FADCFEFD
Rule 2: FADCDCCFD

FADCDCCFD
Rule 1: No
Rule 2: No

This is not leading anywhere.
