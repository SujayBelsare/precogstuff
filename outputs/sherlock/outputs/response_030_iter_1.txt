Okay, I will try to create a state transition diagram in my mind.

Initial state: ADABBBACBFAA

1. Apply rule 1: "BB"->"EB"
ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA

2. Apply rule 1 again:
ADAEBBACBFAA -> ADAEEBACBFAA

Now we have ADAEEBACBFAA. We want to reach ADAECCDEBFAA.

The target string is ADAECCDEBFAA.
The current string is ADAEEBACBFAA.

We need to change EEBACB to ECCDEB.

Let's analyze the differences.
EEBACB -> ECCDEB

Let's look at the rules again:
1) "BB"->"EB"
2) "EBAC"->"CCDB"
3) "ADAECCDEBFAA"->""

We have EBAC -> CCDB.
We have EEBACB. If we could get EBAC, we can apply rule 2. We need to get rid of one E.

Let's re-examine the first steps.
ADABBBACBFAA

1. Apply rule 1: ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA
2. We want to create EBAC, so let's try to isolate EBAC.

Let's try a different approach.
ADABBBACBFAA

Apply rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA
Now we have ADAEBBACBFAA

We want ADAECCDEBFAA. We need to transform EBBACB to ECCDEB.

Let's try to apply rule 2. We need EBAC.
ADAEBBACBFAA. We don't have EBAC.

Let's think step by step.
We need to get to ADAECCDEBFAA.
Let's try working backwards.

ADAECCDEBFAA -> "" (Rule 3)
We need to get to ADAECCDEBFAA from ADABBBACBFAA.

Let's try applying rule 1 repeatedly.
ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA (Rule 1)
ADAEBBACBFAA -> ADAEEBACBFAA (Rule 1)

We have ADAEEBACBFAA.

Let's try a different path.
ADABBBACBFAA
Apply rule 1 once: ADAEBBACBFAA

We want CCDEB from BBACB.
We know EBAC -> CCDB.

Let's analyze the string ADAEBBACBFAA.

If we had EBAC, we could convert it to CCDB.
Let's try to create EBAC.

If we apply rule 1 again, we get ADAEEBACBFAA.

Let's go back to ADAEBBACBFAA.

We want CCDEB.

It looks like applying rule 1 only doesn't lead us anywhere useful. Let's try a different strategy.

ADABBBACBFAA

Let's see if we can apply rule 2.
We need EBAC.
Apply rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

Still no EBAC. We seem to be stuck.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the possibility of applying the rules in a different order or multiple times to the same substring before moving on. Sometimes, a less obvious sequence of transformations is required to reach the target state.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I will try a different order and multiple applications.

Initial: ADABBBACBFAA
Target: ADAECCDEBFAA

We want to transform BBACB to CCDEB.
Rules:
1) BB -> EB
2) EBAC -> CCDB
3) ADAECCDEBFAA -> ""

ADABBBACBFAA
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA
2. Rule 1: ADAEEBACBFAA

We have ADAEEBACBFAA.
Let's try to get EBAC.

Let's go back to ADAEBBACBFAA.
We need CCDEB.

ADABBBACBFAA
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

Let's focus on creating EBAC. We need to remove a B from BBACB.
We have BB -> EB

Let's try a different approach.
ADABBBACBFAA

We want to get to ADAECCDEBFAA.

1. Apply rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

Now we have ADAEBBACBFAA. We want to transform BBACB to CCDEB.

We need EBAC.

If we apply rule 1 again: ADAEEBACBFAA
Still no EBAC.

Let's try to work backwards again.
We need to get ADAECCDEBFAA.

ADABBBACBFAA

Let's try to apply rule 1 three times.
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA
2. Rule 1: ADAEEBACBFAA
This doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

Let's try to apply rule 2 directly. We need EBAC.

ADABBBACBFAA

Let's try to create EBAC.
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

We have EBBACB. We want EBAC.

Let's try another approach.

ADABBBACBFAA
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

We want CCDEB.
If we apply rule 1 again, we get ADAEEBACBFAA.

Let's try the rules in a different order.
We can't apply rule 2 directly.

ADABBBACBFAA
1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA

Let's try something different.

If we apply rule 1 twice, we get ADAEEBACBFAA.
Let's try that.

1. Rule 1: ADAEBBACBFAA
2. Rule 1: ADAEEBACBFAA

Now we have ADAEEBACBFAA. We want to get to ADAECCDEBFAA.

We need to transform EEBACB to ECCDEB.

Let's think. We have EBAC -> CCDB.

What if we could get EEBACB to EBAC somehow?

Okay, let's focus on creating the preconditions for rule 2: EBAC -> CCDB. We need "EBAC" in the string.

Let's rethink the problem.

ADABBBACBFAA
We need to get to ADAECCDEBFAA.

Let's work backwards.

ADAECCDEBFAA -> ""

We need to get from ADABBBACBFAA to ADAECCDEBFAA.

We need BBACB to become CCDEB.
We know EBAC -> CCDB

Let's go back to ADAEBBACBFAA.

We need to create EBAC.

Let's analyze the string ADAEBBACBFAA.

EBBACB.

We need to get EBAC.
Let's try to get rid of a B.

Let's try another approach.

ADABBBACBFAA

Apply rule 1 again: ADAEEBACBFAA.

Still not getting anywhere.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Sometimes, the solution involves transforming the initial string into a form that is significantly different from both the initial and final states, acting as an intermediate step towards enabling the final transformation. Don't be afraid to explore transformations that seem to move away from the target string initially.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
