Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "ADABBBACBFAA" and the available transitions are:

1) "BB"->"EB"
2) "EBAC"->"CCDB"
3) "ADAECCDEBFAA"->""

The goal is to reach an empty string. Let's try applying the rules and see where it leads.

ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA (Rule 1)
ADAEBBACBFAA -> ADAEBACBFAA (Rule 1 - NOT APPLICABLE)
ADAEBACBFAA

It seems like repeated application of rule 1 won't get us to the target string in rule 3. Let's try to see if rule 2 can be applied. We need "EBAC" in the string.

ADAEBBACBFAA does not contain EBAC.

Let's rethink the strategy. Rule 3 takes a very specific and long string and reduces it to "". We need to somehow transform our initial string to match this pattern: "ADAECCDEBFAA".

Current String: "ADABBBACBFAA"

Let's use rule 1 to see if it can help bring the string closer to the pattern in rule 3.
ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA (Rule 1)

Now we have "ADAEBBACBFAA". We want "ADAECCDEBFAA". We currently have "ADAEBBACBFAA". We need to change "BBACB" to "CCDEB". This seems difficult to achieve directly with the given rules.

Let's consider a different approach. If we had "ADAECCDEBFAA", then we could apply rule 3 and be done.
Let's try working backward from "ADAECCDEBFAA". Can we get to "ADAECCDEBFAA" from "ADABBBACBFAA"?
"ADAECCDEBFAA" - Target
"ADABBBACBFAA" - Initial

The differences are:
"BBACB" in the initial string needs to be transformed into "CCDEB" in the target string.

Let's look at the rules again:
1) "BB"->"EB"
2) "EBAC"->"CCDB"
3) "ADAECCDEBFAA"->""

Let's apply rule 1 twice to the initial string.
ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA (Rule 1)
ADAEBBACBFAA -> ADAEEBACBFAA (Rule 1)

Now we have "ADAEBACBFAA". We want "ADAECCDEBFAA". We need "EBACB" to become "CCDEB".
We have "EBAC", so let's try to create "EBAC" to apply rule 2.

We can apply rule 1 to get "ADAEBBACBFAA". Then "ADAEBACBFAA" with another application of rule 1.

Let's try another approach.

Initial: ADABBBACBFAA
Target: ADAECCDEBFAA

1. Apply rule 1 twice:
ADABBBACBFAA -> ADAEBBACBFAA
ADAEBBACBFAA -> ADAEEBACBFAA

Now we have ADAEEBACBFAA. Still far from the target.

Let's think about what we need to create. We need to create "CCDEB" from "BBACB".
We have "BB" -> "EB". And "EBAC" -> "CCDB".

If we apply rule 1 to "ADABBBACBFAA", we get "ADAEBBACBFAA". Then applying rule 1 again gives "ADAEBACBFAA".

Let's look at the target again, "ADAECCDEBFAA". We have "CCDEB".
We want to transform "BBACB" to "CCDEB".
"BB" -> "EB"
