Okay, I need to map how transitions affect strings with shared parts.

A728DB0EA3550

Target: 4BDA72C81C834

1.  "3550"->"883"
2.  "B0EA"->"1E"
3.  "8D"->"C8"
4.  "883"->"64"
5.  "E6"->"C83"
6.  ""->"4BD"
7.  "4BDA72C81C834"->""

A728DB0EA3550

We need to get to "4BDA72C81C834".

Let's focus on getting "4BDA72" somehow.

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 2: A728D1E3550 (B0EA -> 1E)
2. Rule 1: A728D1E883 (3550 -> 883)
3. Rule 4: A728D1E64 (883 -> 64)
4. Rule 5: A728D1C834 (E6 -> C83)

Result: A728D1C834. This doesn't get us closer.

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 1: A728DB0EA883 (3550 -> 883)
2. Rule 2: A728D1E883 (B0EA -> 1E)
3. Rule 4: A728D1E64 (883 -> 64)
4. Rule 5: A728D1C834 (E6 -> C83)

Result: A728D1C834. Still no closer.

Let's try to get 8D to C8 first:

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 2: A728D1E3550 (B0EA -> 1E)
2. Rule 3: A72C81E3550 (8D -> C8)
3. Rule 1: A72C81E883 (3550 -> 883)
4. Rule 4: A72C81E64 (883 -> 64)
5. Rule 5: A72C81C834 (E6 -> C83)

Result: A72C81C834. Not what we want.

I need to find a way to get "4BDA72" in the string.

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 2: A728D1E3550
2. Rule 5: A728D C83 3550 is not possible.
3. Rule 4: A728D1E64
4. Rule 1: A728D1E883

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 1: A728DB0EA883 (3550 -> 883)
2. Rule 3: A72C8B0EA883 (8D -> C8)
3. Rule 2: A72C81EA883 (B0EA -> 1E)
4. Rule 4: A72C81EA64 (883 -> 64)
Now we have A72C81EA64

I am really stuck. I don't see a way to create 4BDA72.

JW HELP!

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on the transformations that create 'C8' and 'C83', and see if you can manipulate the string to get '1' between them.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
