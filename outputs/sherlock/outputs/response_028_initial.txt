Okay, let's analyze the problem. The goal is to transform "FECEA" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "FEC"->"BC"
2) "EA"->"FB"
3) "BCF"->"FD"
4) "FD"->"BA"
5) "BAB"->""

Initial string: "FECEA"

Let's start by applying the transitions and see where it leads.

FECEA -> Applying rule 2:
FECEA -> FECFB

Now we have FECFB. Let's see what we can do.
FECFB -> Applying rule 1:
FECFB -> BCFB

Now we have BCFB.
BCFB -> Applying rule 3:
BCFB -> FDB

Now we have FDB.
FDB -> Applying rule 4:
FDB -> BAB

Now we have BAB.
BAB -> Applying rule 5:
BAB -> ""

So the solution is [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]

FECEA -> FECFB
FECFB -> BCFB
BCFB -> FDB
FDB -> BAB
BAB -> ""

[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]}$
