Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "FEBFC" into "".
Available transitions:
1) "FE"->"AD"
2) ""->"AD"
3) "AD"->"FF"
4) "FFADADADBFC"->""

Initial string: "FEBFC"

Let's explore possible paths.

FEBFC -> ADBFC (1)

Now, we need to somehow get to FFADADADBFC.
ADBFC -> FFBFC (3)
This doesn't seem promising. Let's backtrack.

We need "FFADADADBFC". We have "FEBFC". The target string ends in "BFC", which we already have.
The target string starts with "FFADADA".

Let's see if we can make "ADADA" from "FE".
FE -> AD (1)

So, let's try to create the target from the start.
FEBFC -> ADBFC (1)

We want to get to FFADADADBFC from ADBFC.
We can insert "AD" repeatedly using rule 2. But where?

ADBFC -> ADADBFC (2)
ADADBFC -> ADADADBFC (2)
ADADADBFC -> FFADADADBFC (3)

So, the sequence would be:
FEBFC -> ADBFC (1)
ADBFC -> ADADBFC (2)
ADADBFC -> ADADADBFC (2)
ADADADBFC -> FFADADADBFC (3)
FFADADADBFC -> "" (4)

Therefore, the solution is: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]}$
