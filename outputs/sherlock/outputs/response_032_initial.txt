Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully.
Available transitions:
1) "A"->"EF"
2) "EFE"->"EFF"
3) "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

Initial string: "ABBFAEABF"

The goal is to reach an empty string. We have a large transition that eliminates "EFBBFEFFEFBF". Let's try to create that.

ABBFAEABF -> EFBBFAEABF (1)
EFBBFAEABF -> EFBBFEFABF (1)
EFBBFEFABF -> EFBBFEFEFBF (1)
EFBBFEFEFBF -> EFBBFEFFEFBF (2)

Now we can apply transition 3.

So the solution is [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Let's verify:
ABBFAEABF
EFBBFAEABF (1)
EFBBFEFABF (1)
EFBBFEFEFBF (1)
EFBBFEFFEFBF (2)
"" (3)

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}$
