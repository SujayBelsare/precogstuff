Okay, rule 6 is "CEBBAB" -> "". This means we need to somehow transform "BDEEEFC" into "CEBBAB". The presence of 'C' at the beginning of the target string suggests we need to create it somehow. The only way to create a 'C' seems to be using rule 2, which requires the string to be empty. That's impossible at the beginning. So, we should focus on creating the substring "EBBAB" and then prepending 'C' to it.

The initial string is "BDEEEFC".

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1: "FC" -> "BE")

Now we have "BDEEEBE". We want to get something close to "EBBAB".

2. **BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE** (Rule 3: "E" -> "EF")

Now we have "BDFFEEBE".

3. **BDFFEEBE -> BDFFEEAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Now we have "BDFFEEAB".

4. **BDFFEEAB -> BDFEABAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Now we have "BDFEABAB". This doesn't seem right. Let's go back to step 2 and try something else.

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1: "FC" -> "BE")

Now we have "BDEEEBE".

2. **BDEEEBE -> BDEFEBE** (Rule 3: "E" -> "EF")

Now we have "BDEFEBE".

3. **BDEFEBE -> BDEFEAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Now we have "BDEFEAB". This still doesn't seem right.

Let's try a different approach. We need to get "EBBAB". Let's try to isolate it.

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1: "FC" -> "BE")

Now we have "BDEEEBE".

2. **BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE** (Rule 3: "E" -> "EF")

Now we have "BDFFEEBE".

3. **BDFFEEBE -> BDFFEEAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Now we have "BDFFEEAB".

4. **BDFFEEAB -> BDFEABAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Still not working. Let's try another approach. The goal is "CEBBAB".

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1: "FC" -> "BE")

Now we have "BDEEEBE".

2. **BDEEEBE -> EBEBBDEF** (Rule 4 reversed is impossible).

We need to make "CEBBAB". Let's try to get "BBDEFEEB".

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1: "FC" -> "BE")

Now we have "BDEEEBE".

2. **BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE** (Rule 3: "E" -> "EF")

Now we have "BDFFEEBE".

3. **BDFFEEBE -> BDFFEEAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Now we have "BDFFEEAB".

4. **BDFFEEAB -> BDFEABAB** (Rule 5: "BE" -> "AB")

Still not helpful.

Let's think step by step. We have BDEEEFC. We want to get CEBBAB.

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1)
2. **BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE** (Rule 3)
3. **BDFFEEBE -> BDFFEEAB** (Rule 5)
4. **BDFFEEAB -> BDFEABAB** (Rule 5)

Let's try something completely different.

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1)
2. **BDEEEBE -> EBEBBDEF** (Cannot apply rule 4 in reverse)

Since the initial string is BDEEEFC, and the final string needs to be CEBBAB, let's focus on creating EBBAB somehow.

1. **BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE** (Rule 1)

Now we have BDEEEBE.

2. **BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE** (Rule 3)

Now we have BDFFEEBE.

3. **BDFFEEBE -> BDFFEEAB** (Rule 5)

Now we have BDFFEEAB.

4. **BDFFEEAB -> BDFEABAB** (Rule 5)
Still not working.

I'm stuck. I need to start over.
