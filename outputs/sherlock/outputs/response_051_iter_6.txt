Okay, I am going back to the beginning.
I was on the right track with applying rule 1 first!
I need to focus on how to apply rule 4 after rule 1.

1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
Now I have BDEEEBE.
Rule 4: BBDEFEEB -> EBBB

Wait a minute...

What if I apply rule 5 to the last BE?
1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
2. BDEEEBE -> BDEEEAB [5]
Now I have BDEEEAB.
That's not helpful.

I am missing something.

Okay, I am going to try to work backwards.
I need to get to "".
The rule that gets me to "" is CEBBAB -> ""
To get CEBBAB, I need CE and BBAB.

Let's try:
1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
Now I have BDEEEBE.
2. Apply rule 3 to the first E:
BDEEEBE -> BDEFEBE [3]
Now I have BDEFEBE.

I still don't see a CE.

Okay, I am going to stop trying to get CE first.
I am going to try to get BBDEFEEB.

Rule 1: FC -> BE
Rule 3: E -> EF
Rule 4: BBDEFEEB -> EBBB
Rule 5: BE -> AB

Let's try applying rule 3 to the last E:
1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
Now I have BDEEEBE
2. Apply rule 3 to the last E:
BDEEEBE -> BDEEEFBE [3]
Now I have BDEEEFBE.

This is not helping.

I am going to try to think abstractly.

BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
I have BDEEEBE.

What if I apply rule 5 to the last BE?
BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
BDEEEBE -> BDEEEAB [5]
Now I have BDEEEAB.

I need to get to CEBBAB.
I need CE.
I can't create CE.

Okay, I am going to go back to the drawing board.
I am going to start with BDEEEFC.
I need to get to "".

There is only one rule that gets me to "": CEBBAB -> ""
So, I need to create CEBBAB.
I need CE and BBAB.
I can create BE using FC -> BE.
I can create AB using BE -> AB.

So, let's try:
1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
Now I have BDEEEBE.

Then what?
I need to somehow get CEBBAB.
I can get BE at the end.
Then BE -> AB.
So, I need to get CEBBA.

I am stuck.

Let's try to use rule 4: BBDEFEEB -> EBBB
I need to somehow create BBDEFEEB.
If I have BBDEFEEB, then I can get EBBB.

BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
Then what?

JW HELP!
STOP
