Okay, let's rethink this completely. The feedback is that I'm applying a transition that isn't producing the expected outcome. This suggests I'm focusing too much on directly converting to "FAFDCCFE" and overlooking a simpler path.

Initial string: "FAFEFD"
Transitions:
1) "FD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"DC"
3) "FAFDCCFE"->""

My previous approach was to apply rule 2 to the *second* E in "FAFEFD" to get "FAFEDCD", then get stuck.

What if I apply rule 2 to the *first* E in "FAFEFD"?
"FAFEFD" -> "FADCFDFD"
This looks even worse!

Let's think about the *goal*. The goal is to get to "FAFDCCFE" so we can apply rule 3.

"FAFEFD"
What if we apply rule 1 first? It seems counter-intuitive because it will make the string longer.
"FAFEFD" -> "FAFEFE"

Now what?
We can apply rule 2 to the *first* E.
"FAFEFE" -> "FADCFEFE"
This is even worse.

Let's try applying rule 2 to the *second* E.
"FAFEFE" -> "FAFDCFE"

Now we are getting somewhere! We want "FAFDCCFE". We have "FAFDCFE".
We can apply rule 2 again to the *last* E.
"FAFDCFE" -> "FAFDCCFE"

Now we can apply rule 3.
"FAFDCCFE" -> ""

So the solution is:
1. Apply rule 1: "FAFEFD" -> "FAFEFE"
2. Apply rule 2 to the *second* E: "FAFEFE" -> "FAFDCFE"
3. Apply rule 2 to the *last* E: "FAFDCFE" -> "FAFDCCFE"
4. Apply rule 3: "FAFDCCFE" -> ""

The transitions are [1, 2, 2, 3].
