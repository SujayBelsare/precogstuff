Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "FEBDADEFB" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "FE"->"AC"
2) "ADE"->"DCAE"
3) "EF"->"AAABB"
4) "BDDCAAAA"->"DDEEBEB"
5) "DE"->"BDCFBB"
6) "ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB"->""

Let's start by applying rule 1 to "FEBDADEFB":
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB

Now, let's consider applying rule 2 to "ACBDADEFB". It requires "ADE", but we have "ADE" in the string. However, if we applied rule 2, it would become "DCAE", and it doesn't seem like "DCAE" will lead to the final state.

Let's try applying rule 3 to initial string "FEBDADEFB". It requires "EF", but we don't have "EF".

Let's try applying rule 5 to initial string "FEBDADEFB". It requires "DE", and we have "DE".
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB

This doesn't look promising. Let's go back to "ACBDADEFB". We can apply rule 5 to "DE" again. So we have ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB.

Again, this seems hopeless. Let's start over and explore different paths.

Initial string: "FEBDADEFB"

1) FE -> AC
"ACBDADEFB"

Now, let's try to see what happens if we apply rule 2 before rule 1.
FEBDADEFB
ADE -> DCAE. We need to find "ADE" in the string.
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDDCAEFB

This doesn't look promising. Let's go back and stick to applying rule 1 first.
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB

Now, let's try to apply rule 5 to "DE":
ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB

This doesn't seem to help either.

Let's think backward. We need to get "ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB". Can we somehow generate this from "FEBDADEFB"?

Let's try applying rule 1:
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB

Let's try applying rule 2:
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDDCAEFB

Let's try applying rule 3:
We can't apply rule 3 as it requires EF.

Let's try applying rule 5:
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB

Let's go back to ACBDADEFB.
ACBDADEFB

Let's apply rule 5, DE -> BDCFBB
ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB

Let's try rule 1 first, then apply rule 2:
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB
ACBDADEFB ->
Let's apply rule 5 to ACBDADEFB: ACBDBDCFBBFB

Let's try applying rule 1 and then rule 5:
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB
ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB

We need to somehow create "ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB".
Let's try a different approach.
Let's apply rule 2 first.
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDDCAEFB
It doesn't seem that applying rule 2 first will lead to the correct answer.

FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB.  Now we need to somehow get BDDCAAAA.
Let's try applying rule 5: ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB

Let's try 1 then 5: FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB
Let's try 5 then 1: FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB -> ACBDABDCFBBFB

Let's start with 1: FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB
Then apply 5: ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB

Let's try 1, then 5, then 1:
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB -> ACCBDBDCFBBFB

Let's try to apply rule 5 before rule 1:
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB

Let's go back to basics. We can try the transitions in different orders.
We know we need "ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB" at some point.

Let's apply rule 1: FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB
Now, let's apply rule 2: ACBDADEFB -> ACBDDCAEFB

Let's apply rule 5: FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB
Let's apply rule 1 after that: FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB -> ACBDABDCFBBFB

Let's start again:
FEBDADEFB
Apply 1: ACBDADEFB
Apply 5: ACBDBDCFBBFB
Apply 6: This won't work

FEBDADEFB

Apply 1: ACBDADEFB

Apply 2: We need ADE. ACBDADEFB. So ACBDDCAEFB

Apply 5: We need DE. FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB

Let's see if we can apply rule 4. We need BDDCAAAA
We need the final string to be ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB.

Let's restart.

FEBDADEFB
1. FE -> AC : ACBDADEFB
2. ADE -> DCAE : ACBDDCAEFB
3. EF -> AAABB : N/A
4. BDDCAAAA : N/A
5. DE -> BDCFBB : ACBDBDCFBBFB
6. ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB

Let's think. If we could get ADE -> DCAE, maybe we can make something.
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB (1)
Then ACBDADEFB -> ACBDBDCFBBFB (5)
Then ACCBDBDCFBBFB (1)
Then nothing.

FEBDADEFB
Apply rule 1: ACBDADEFB
Apply rule 5: ACBDBDCFBBFB

Lets reverse think. The last rule must be 6.
ACDBDCFBBEBEBBBB

Let's start with rule 1:
FEBDADEFB -> ACBDADEFB

Let's start with rule 5:
FEBDADEFB -> FEBDABDCFBBFB

Okay, I am stuck.
JW HELP!
STOP
