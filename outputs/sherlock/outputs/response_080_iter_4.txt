Okay, I need to think about what happens to the initial characters when applying the first rule. Do any of those initial characters affect future transformations?

"3431F2DC"
Target: "" using "953A06385CDC" -> ""

1. Rule 1: "F2" -> "06"
2. Rule 2: "106" -> "2BA"
3. Rule 3: "2B" -> "43"
4. Rule 4: "43A" -> "85C"
5. Rule 5: "" -> "95"
6. Rule 6: "4" -> "A06"
7. Rule 7: "953A06385CDC" -> ""

I need to get from "3431F2DC" to "953A06385CDC".

Let's analyze the target string: "953A06385CDC".
We need to somehow create this string.

"3431F2DC"

I have been focusing on getting "3A06385CDC" and then "95". This isn't working.

The '3' at the beginning of the initial string needs to stay a '3' in the target string.
The '4' becomes 'A06'.
The '1' becomes part of '2BA' then '43', then '85C'.
The "F2" becomes "06".

Let's apply rule 1 first:
1. Apply Rule 1: "F2" -> "06"
"3431F2DC" -> "343106DC" [1]

Now, let's apply rule 6 on the '4':
2. Apply Rule 6: "4" -> "A06"
"343106DC" -> "3A063106DC" [6]

Now we have "3A063106DC".

Now, let's apply rule 2 on "106":
3. Apply Rule 2: "106" -> "2BA"
"3A063106DC" -> "3A0632BADC" [2]

Now we have "3A0632BADC".

Now, let's apply rule 3 on "2B":
4. Apply Rule 3: "2B" -> "43"
"3A0632BADC" -> "3A06343ADC" [3]

Now we have "3A06343ADC".

Now, let's apply rule 4 on "43A":
5. Apply Rule 4: "43A" -> "85C"
"3A06343ADC" -> "3A06385CDC" [4]

Now we have "3A06385CDC".

I need "953A06385CDC".

I am missing "95".

So the only way to eliminate "3A06385CDC" is if it is "953A06385CDC" and then use rule 7.

I am completely stuck.

I am going to try something completely different.

"3431F2DC"

What if I try to make "95" first somehow?

There is no way to make "95".

So the solution is impossible.
