Okay, let's break this down. I need to find a sequence of transitions that turns CBBEC into "".

Transitions:
1) BEC -> CD
2) BC -> BB
3) CBB -> EEF
4) FD -> ED
5) EEED -> ""

CBBEC

I am going to try to work backwards.

I need to get to EEED.

I am going to start over.

CBBEC

Let's try applying transition 2 first.

CBBEC
Apply 2: BC -> BB
CBBBC

Now I have CBBBC.

What should I do now?

I am going to try applying transition 3.

CBBBC
Apply 3: CBB -> EEF
EEFBC

Now I have EEFBC.

What should I do now?
I am going to try applying transition 2 again.

EEFBC
Apply 2: BC -> BB
EEFBB

What should I do now?

None of the transitions seem to be working.

I am going to call John Watson again.

John Watson says:

Okay, let's take a different approach. The goal is to get to EEED. Is there a transition that creates a 'D' in the string?

Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).

You're getting *so* close! You have CBBEC -> CBBBC -> EEFBC -> EEFBB. Now, go back to the *original* string CBBEC and think about applying transition 1. How does that change the possible steps you can take?
