Okay, let's try working backward from the final state, as suggested.

The final state is "". To get to "", we need to apply transition 5: "EAEEACBEAACB" -> "".
So, we need to transform "DFDDACBEC" into "EAEEACBEAACB".

Let's analyze the differences:
Initial:   DFDDACBEC
Target: EAEEACBEAACB

1. Apply transition 1: "DFDD" -> "BEA"
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC

Now we have:
BEAACBEC
We need to get:
EAEEACBEAACB

The difference is quite significant. Let's try another starting point. What if we apply transition 3 first?

1. Apply transition 3: "" -> "EAC"
DFDDACBEC -> DFDDACBECEAC

This doesn't seem to bring us closer.

Let's go back to applying transition 1 first.
1. Apply transition 1: "DFDD" -> "BEA"
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC

2. Apply transition 2: "CBEC" -> "CB"
BEAACBEC -> BEAACB

Now we have BEAACB.
We want EAEEACBEAACB.
So we need to prepend EAEEAC.

Let's try to use transition 3 and 4 to build EAEEAC.
We can create EAC using transition 3, and convert EAC to EAE using transition 4.

1. DFDDACBEC
2. Apply 1: BEA
BEAACBEC
3. Apply 2: CBEC->CB
BEAACB
4. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEAC
5. Apply 4: EAC->EAE
BEAACBEAE
6. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEAEEAC

We now have BEAACBEAEEAC.  We want EAEEACBEAACB.
The remaining part needed is "EA".  We can't readily make "EA".

Let's rethink this again.

We need to transform DFDDACBEC to EAEEACBEAACB.

If we apply transition 1, we get BEAACBEC.  If we apply transition 2, we get BEAACB.  We want to insert EAEEAC.

DFDDACBEC
1. Apply 1: DFDD -> BEA
BEAACBEC
2. Apply 2: CBEC -> CB
BEAACB

At this point we have BEAACB.
We want EAEEACBEAACB.
We need EAEEAC.

Perhaps we should insert EAC using transition 3, then use transition 4 repeatedly.
DFDDACBEC
1. Apply 1: DFDD -> BEA
BEAACBEC
2. Apply 2: CBEC -> CB
BEAACB
3. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEAC
4. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEACEAC
5. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEACEACEAC

This is not working.

Let's try another approach. Let's try to create EAC earlier.
DFDDACBEC
1. Apply 3: ""->EAC
DFDDACBECEAC

This is not helping.

DFDDACBEC
1. Apply 1: DFDD -> BEA
BEAACBEC
2. Apply 2: CBEC -> CB
BEAACB
3. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEAC

4. Apply 4: EAC -> EAE
BEAACBEAE

5. Apply 3: ""->EAC
BEAACBEAEEAC

We are at BEAACBEAEEAC.  We need to get to EAEEACBEAACB.

We are not making progress.

I am stuck.
