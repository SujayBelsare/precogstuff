Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "BFEFCCDCADC" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"

Let's try to apply the transitions. The string contains "DCADC", so we can apply rule 1:

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC  [1]

Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC". Let's see if we can apply any rules. We can apply rule 2 to the first 'C':

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

Now we have "BFEFBBDBEBCC". It doesn't seem like any of the rules directly apply. Let's try applying rule 2 to all the 'C's in "BFEFCCDCADC" before applying rule 1.

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFBDCBDCADBDC [2]

This doesn't seem to be getting us closer. Let's try applying rule 2 to the Cs in "BFEFCBCEBCC" one by one.

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

BFEFBBDBEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBDD [2]

BFEFBBDBEBDD -> BFEFBBDBEBDBD [2]

Still not getting closer. Let's go back to "BFEFCBCEBCC" and try to apply rule 3. We need to somehow get "BDEBCC" in the string. It seems difficult. Let's try a different approach. We need to somehow get "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" in the string.

Let's look at the string "BFEFCCDCADC" again. If we can somehow transform "CCDCADC" into "FEBDBDEEDCCB" then we are good.

Let's go back to applying rule 1 first.

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Then apply rule 2 to all Cs.

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBDBD [2, 2, 2]

This doesn't seem right.

Let's go back to "BFEFCCDCADC". Apply rule 1:

BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Now apply rule 2 to the first C:

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

Now, no rules apply directly. Let's try applying rule 2 to the second C:

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]

Still no luck.

Let's try applying rule 1 again to the original string:

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Apply rule 2 to the second C:
BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]
Apply rule 2 again to the third C:
BFEFCBDBEBCC -> BFEFCBDBEBDD [2]

No luck.

Let's focus on getting "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB". We have "BFEF" at the beginning of our initial string "BFEFCCDCADC". So, we need to transform "CCDCADC" to "BDBDEEDCCB".
If we apply rule 1 we get "BFEFCBCEBCC".
If we apply rule 2 to all "C"s we get "BFEFBBDBEBDBD".
This doesn't seem to lead anywhere.
