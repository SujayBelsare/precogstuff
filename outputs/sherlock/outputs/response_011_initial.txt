Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "BCCFEEFC" and the target is "". We have the following transitions:

1) "CCFEE"->"ABBE"
2) "BAB"->"AAE"
3) "AAEB"->"FD"
4) "EF"->"CD"
5) "FDCDC"->""

Let's trace possible paths. Applying rule 1 to the initial string gives us "BABBEFC".

"BCCFEEFC" -> "BABBEFC" [1]

Now we have "BABBEFC". We need to get to "FDCDC". Applying rule 2 doesn't seem useful yet. Let's try to get an "EF" using rule 4. Rule 4 turns "EF" to "CD".

"BABBEFC" -> "BABBECD" [4]

Now we have "BABBECD". Let's try to use rule 2, which requires "BAB".

"BABBECD" -> "AAEBECD" [2]

Now we have "AAEBECD". Rule 3 can be applied.

"AAEBECD" -> "FDECD" [3]

Now we have "FDECD". We are close to "FDCDC". Let us apply rule 4 again.

"FDECD" -> "FDCDC" [4]

Now we have "FDCDC". Applying rule 5 finishes it.

"FDCDC" -> "" [5]

So the complete sequence is:
"BCCFEEFC" -> "BABBEFC" -> "BABBECD" -> "AAEBECD" -> "FDECD" -> "FDCDC" -> ""
The transitions are [1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5]

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5]
