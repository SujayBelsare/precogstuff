Okay, the ultimate goal is to get "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" so that I can apply rule 4.

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"

1. Apply rule 1: "BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC".

2. We need to create BFEFBDBDEEDCCB

Apply Rule 2 where?
We have CBCEBCC

We need to get BDBDEEDCCB

To apply rule 3 we need BDEBCC

Let's apply Rule 2 to the first C in CBCEBCC
BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

We need to get to BDBDEEDCCB

So far:
BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
Then we apply Rule 2 to the First C
BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

BBDBEBCC

BFEFBDBDEEDCCB

To apply Rule 3 we need to create BDEBCC

We have BBDBEBCC

If we apply Rule 2 to second C
BFEFBDBBDEBCC

Then Rule 3
BFEFBDBBEEDCCB

The answer is very close

BFEFCCDCADC
1) BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
2) BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
BBDBEBCC
3) BFEFBDBBDEBCC [2]
4) BFEFBDBBEEDCCB [3]

BFEFCCDCADC -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

I need to find the right C

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
Apply Rule 2 to the First C BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
Apply Rule 2 to the second C BFEFBDBBDEBCC [2]

Apply Rule 3: BFEFBDBBEEDCCB

I was wrong.

Apply Rule 4

[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]

"BFEFCCDCADC"
"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Apply Rule 2 to the first C BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

There is an extra B

Then apply Rule 4

Okay

"BFEFCCDCADC"

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You are extremely close. You've correctly identified the first three steps. However, double-check your *initial* application of rule 2. The goal is to create a substring that can be easily transformed into "EEDCCB" using rule 3.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).

I am so close. The key is the *initial* application of rule 2. I need to make BDEBCC!

"BFEFCCDCADC"

1. Apply Rule 1: "BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
Now I have "BFEFCBCEBCC".

I have CBCEBCC
I need to turn it into BDEBCC using Rule 2

The only thing I can do is to replace C with BD.

So apply rule 2 to the *second* C of CBCEBCC.
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]

Now I have CBDBEBCC.

Can I make BDEBCC? No.

Can I get to BFEFBDBDEEDCCB? No.

"BFEFCCDCADC"
Apply rule 1 "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Apply Rule 2 to the *FIRST C* of CBCEBCC
"BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]

Now I have BBDBEBCC

Can I get BDEBCC?

Apply Rule 2 to the second C.
"BFEFBDBBDEBCC" [2]

Then apply Rule 3.

"BFEFBDBBEEDCC
