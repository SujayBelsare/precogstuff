Okay, let's try working backward. The final transition is:
6) "0D1D6CD927"->""

So, we need to get "0D1D6CD927" from "070B6C4".
We have the following transitions:
1) "C4"->"B1E"
2) "70"->"DE"
3) "E"->"27"
4) "27B"->"1D"
5) "B1"->"CD9"

Let's try to build "0D1D6CD927" from "070B6C4". We need to introduce "1D" and "CD9" and "27".

First, let's apply transition 1 to "070B6C4":
"070B6C4" -> "070B6B1E" [1]

Now we have "070B6B1E". Let's apply transition 5 to "070B6B1E":
"070B6B1E" -> "070B6CD9E" [5]

Now we have "070B6CD9E". Let's apply transition 3 to "070B6CD9E":
"070B6CD9E" -> "070B6CD927" [3]

Now we have "070B6CD927". Let's apply transition 2 to "070B6CD927":
"070B6CD927" -> "0DEB6CD927" [2]

Now we have "0DEB6CD927". We need "0D1D6CD927". So, we need to transform "EB" to "1D".
We have the rule "27B"->"1D". So, we need to create "27" before "B". We have "E" before "B".
Apply transition 3 to the string "0DEB6CD927".
"0DEB6CD927" -> "0D27B6CD927" [3]

Now we have "0D27B6CD927". We can apply transition 4 to "0D27B6CD927".
"0D27B6CD927" -> "0D1D6CD927" [4]

Finally, we can apply transition 6 to "0D1D6CD927".
"0D1D6CD927" -> "" [6]

So the sequence of transitions is [1, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 6]. However, we are only supposed to output transformations to empty string, not including the final transition. Therefore the answer is [1, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4]
