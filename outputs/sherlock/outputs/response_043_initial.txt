Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "DDECFACFBDCDEBCF" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the provided transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "EBC"->"EC"
2) "CD"->"DF"
3) "CF"->"CF"
4) "ACFBDDFECF"->"DAEBFD"
5) "DDECFDAEBFD"->""

Let's try to apply the transitions strategically. Notice transition 5 eliminates a long string. So we must aim to produce "DDECFDAEBFD".

Initial String: "DDECFACFBDCDEBCF"

1. Apply transition 1 to eliminate "EBC".
"DDECFACFBDCDEBCF" -> "DDECFACFBDCD**EC**F" (No EBC here, so rule 1 does not apply)

Let's look at the string and the target of rule 5 again:
Initial String: "DDECFACFBDCDEBCF"
Target: "DDECFDAEBFD"

We see that the string starts with "DDECF", like the target. Let us see if we can generate "DAEBFD" from "ACFBDCDEBCF".

We need to produce ACFBDDFECF from ACFBDCDEBCF. Let us try to get ACFBDDFECF:
"ACFBDCDEBCF"

Apply rule 2 on CD:
"ACFBDCDEBCF" -> "ACFB**DF**EBCF"
Now we have EBC which can be eliminated with rule 1.
"ACFBDFEBCF" -> "ACFBDFECF"
Now we can apply rule 4, since we have "ACFBDDFECF":
"ACFBDDFECF" -> "DAEBFD"

So far:
"DDECFACFBDCDEBCF" -> "DDECFACFBDFEBCF" -> "DDECFACFBDFECF" -> "DDECFDAEBFD"

Now we can apply rule 5.
"DDECFDAEBFD" -> ""

The sequence of rules is: 2, 1, 4, 5

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 4, 5]}$
STOP.
