Start: ABEBC

We want to get FFDFDA so we can apply rule 4: FFDFDA -> "".

The rules are:
1) EBC -> CCA
2) C -> FD
3) ABFD -> FC
4) FFDFDA -> ""

We need to create FFDFDA.

Let's analyze the rules again:
1) EBC -> CCA
2) C -> FD
3) ABFD -> FC

We have ABEBC.

1. ABEBC -> ACCA (Rule 1)
Now we have ACCA.

Let's try to create ABFD.
We have ACCA.
We can apply rule 2: C -> FD.
So ACCA -> AFDA

We need to find a way to create ABFD.

Start: ABEBC
Apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
Apply rule 2: ACCA -> AFDA

Let's try to use rule 3: ABFD -> FC

Start: ABEBC.
We need to create ABFD.

1. Apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Apply rule 2 to the first C: ACCA -> AFDA.
3. Apply rule 2 to the second C: AFDA -> AFDFDA

Let's focus on getting FFDFDA:
Start: ABEBC
1. Apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Apply rule 2 twice to get AFDFDA

We need to change the A to F.

Let's try a different approach.
We have ABEBC.
We want ABFD.
Let's start with rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA.

I'm still stuck.
