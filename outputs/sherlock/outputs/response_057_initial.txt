Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "DAEADCF" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "EA"->"DD"
2) "DDC"->"ABDED"
3) ""->"BB"
4) "BDEDF"->"CDFDD"
5) "BBBBDADACDFDD"->""

Initial string: "DAEADCF"

Let's start by applying the transitions and see where it leads us:

1. **DAEADCF -> DDDADCF** (Applying rule 1: EA -> DD to the first EA)

Now we have "DDDADCF". We don't see any immediate matches for rules 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, if we could create "DDC", we could use rule 2. Let's see if we can use rule 1 to create another "DD". However, "AD" does not have a rule associated with it.

Let's try a different approach. The final rule is "BBBBDADACDFDD"->"", so we need to get to that string eventually. We currently have "DAEADCF".

Let's see what happens if we repeatedly apply rule 1:
1. DAEADCF -> DDDADCF
We still don't have anything directly useful.

Let's try to work backwards from the final state "BBBBDADACDFDD". We need to somehow generate this from "DAEADCF".
Let's look at rule 4: "BDEDF"->"CDFDD". If we can create BDEDF, that would get us CDFDD, which is part of the final rule.
Let's look at rule 2: "DDC"->"ABDED". If we can create DDC, that gets us closer to BDEDF.
Let's look at rule 1: "EA"->"DD". This can help us create "DD".

So, the strategy seems to be:
1. Use rule 1 to create DD.
2. Use rule 2 to create ABDED (if we can get DDC).
3. Use rule 4 to create CDFDD.
4. Try to build the rest of the final string.

Let's try applying the rules in a different order. Is there a sequence that immediately generates CDFDD from the initial string? No.

Going back to DDDADCF:
Is there a way to generate "DDC" from this? We have "DDDADCF".

Maybe we need to use rule 3 (""->"BB") at some point to introduce extra Bs. It seems unlikely to be useful at the beginning.

Let's focus on creating "DDC" so we can use rule 2. We have "DAEADCF" -> "DDDADCF". We need a "C" between two "D"s. We don't have a rule to insert a "C".

Let's analyze the target string: "BBBBDADACDFDD".
We have "DAEADCF". We need to add "BBBB" at the beginning, change "E" to "A", add "A", "CD", and change "F" to "DD".

Let's focus on rule 4: "BDEDF"->"CDFDD". We need to create "BDEDF".
Let's focus on rule 2: "DDC"->"ABDED". We need to create "DDC".
Let's focus on rule 1: "EA"->"DD". We can use this to create "DD".

Let's try this:
1. DAEADCF -> DDDADCF (Rule 1)

We need to get "DDC" from this. We could try adding a 'C' somehow, but there is no rule for that.

Let's call for help.
