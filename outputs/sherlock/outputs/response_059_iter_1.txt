Okay, let's use backtracking and think about how to get to "FDBBDD" which is the key to solving this problem since rule 5 transforms "FDBBDD" to "".

Initial String: FCFFD

1. We want to get "FDBBDD".  We know "CD" -> "DB" (rule 4). So, if we can get "FCDDD", then we can get "FDBBDD".
2. Current string: FCFFD
3. Let's try to get "CFFD" to transform to "DD" using rule 3.
4. FCFFD -> FDD [3]
5. Now we need to get to "FDBBDD" from "FDD".
6. We need to introduce "BB" between the last two "D"s. And also a "DB" before "BB". That means creating "DBBDD" from "DD".
7. We know from Rule 4 that "CD" -> "DB".  So, let's see if we can get "FCDDD" from "FCFFD" instead of "FDD".
8. Initial string: FCFFD
9. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
10. Now we have FCCECD. We want FCDDD or at least a CD.
11. From FCCECD, we can change EC to FF by Rule 2.
12. FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]
13.  Now we have FCFFCD. We want FCDDD.
14. The key now is to convert one of the "FF"s in "FCFFCD" into "D".  But there's no direct way to do that.
15.  Let's go back to the string FCCECD and try a different path.
16. FCCECD. Let's create CD using rule 4 in reverse.
17. Let's rethink.

We need to create FDBBDD.
We can get DB from CD (rule 4).

1. FCFFD.
2. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
3. FCCECD
4. Now, we need "DBBDD" to complete "FDBBDD".
5. We know CD -> DB. So we need CDDD.
6. Let's try to create "CD" from "CCECD".
7. FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]
8. FCFFCD. Still difficult.
9. Back to FCCECD again!

Let's focus on creating FDBBDD directly.
FDBBDD.

Let's think outside the box.

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> F(CCECD)D [1]
2. FCCECD -> FC(FF)CD [2]
3. FCFFCD
4. Can we make it work from here?
5. FDBBDD -> "" [5]

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FDD [3]

No, it's not working. Let's try to work backwards.
We need FDBBDD.
To get FDBBDD, we need to somehow generate FDBBDD from FCFFD.

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
2. FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]

Here's another approach:

1. FCFFD
2. We need DBBDD.
3. CD -> DB
4. FCFFD -> FDD [3]

Let's go back to basics.

1. FCFFD
2. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
3. FCCECD.
4. Now, we need a CD.
5. FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]

Let's try to construct "FDBBDD" from the beginning.

FCFFD
1.  FCFFD -> F(CCECD)D [1]
2.  FCCECD -> FC(FF)CD [2]
3.  FCFFCD. We need "BBDD".
4.  CD -> DB

Let's try a completely different approach:

1. FCFFD
2. FCFFD -> FDD [3]

Let's go back to the start and be systematic.

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
2. FCCECD.

We need to get rid of the 'CC'.
We want FDBBDD.

FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]
This doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

Final attempt:

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FDD [3] // CFFD -> DD
Now we have FDD.
We want FDBBDD. This requires inserting BB between the two Ds and DB before the first BB.

Let's start over.

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
2. FCCECD -> FCFFCD [2]
3. FCFFCD

We are stuck.
