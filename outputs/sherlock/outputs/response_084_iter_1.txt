Okay, I missed a crucial detail about modifying only the *first* matching substring. Let's re-evaluate the problem with this in mind.

Initial string: "74865EC56AF"
Transitions:
1) ""->"EC"
2) "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"->""

We need to get to "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".  Let's analyze how we can get there from the initial string "74865EC56AF". Applying rule 2 is still a good starting point since it transforms a substring that exists in the initial string:

"74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E"  [2]

Now we have "74865E2044CF7E". We need to prepend "ECECECECEC" to this string. Rule 1 allows us to create "EC".  However, we can't insert it directly into the middle of the string. Rule 1 only creates "EC" when the string is empty. Let's try something else.

Let's rethink. The final transition, rule 3, requires the entire string to match "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". We currently have "74865EC56AF". Applying transition 2 gives us "74865E2044CF7E".

The only way to create "EC" is from nothing. Since we can't insert "EC" in the middle of a string, prepending "ECECECECEC" by repeatedly applying rule 1 won't work.

I'm still missing something. Let's re-examine the transitions and the initial string. We have "74865EC56AF". Notice the "C56AF" part. Transition 2 transforms "C56AF" into "2044CF7E". So, "74865EC56AF" becomes "74865E2044CF7E" by applying transition 2. Now, we need to somehow get "ECECECECEC" in front.

Let's consider the possibility that the initial string is *designed* to be misleading. Maybe we *don't* need to use transition 2 at all. Instead, let's consider how we could potentially *insert* "EC" into the string. We can't.

Aha! I think I see it now. We're focusing too much on the literal string values. We must find a way to get to the input of rule 3: "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". We have "74865EC56AF".
Applying rule 2, we get "74865E2044CF7E". We need to prepend "ECECECECEC". However, we *cannot* directly modify the string to insert this. We are missing a way to modify the "74865E2044CF7E" part.

I'm stuck again.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Think carefully about the order in which you apply the transformations. Are you making any assumptions about the string that might not be valid?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
