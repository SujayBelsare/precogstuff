Okay, I see. I was too quick to dismiss the initial application of rule 1. Let's explore this more thoroughly.

Initial string: "EDFDDBECF"
Goal: ""
Transitions:
1) "CF"->"DF"
2) "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
3) ""->"CB"
4) "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""

1. Apply rule 1: "CF"->"DF"
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Now we have EDFDDBEDF. We need to somehow get to "CBCBEBAEEDF".

Notice that rule 2 transforms "EDFDDBE" into "EBAEE". We have "EDFDDBE" in "EDFDDBEDF" if we ignore the last "DF".

2. Apply rule 2: "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF

Now we have "EBAEEDF". We need to get to "CBCBEBAEEDF". We have "EBAEEDF". We are missing CBCB at the beginning. We need to insert "CBCB" at the beginning. Rule 3 allows us to insert "CB" at the beginning of an empty string. But that's not helpful here.

We have "EBAEEDF". We need "CBCBEBAEEDF". Let's look at the differences.
CBCBEBAEEDF
EBAEEDF

We need to insert CBCB at the beginning.

Let's reconsider the initial steps.

1. Apply rule 1: "CF"->"DF"
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

2. Apply rule 2: "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF

Now we have EBAEEDF. We need CBCBEBAEEDF.

Let's think about the end goal. We need CBCBEBAEEDF.
We have EBAEEDF.

Let's go back to EDFDDBECF.

What if we don't apply rule 1 initially?

We have EDFDDBECF. We want CBCBEBAEEDF.
We need to somehow get an 'EDFDDBE' in the string. We already have that.

EDFDDBECF
Apply rule 2 is not directly applicable since we have EDFDDBECF and not EDFDDBE.
Let's try rule 1 first: EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF.
Then apply rule 2: EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF

Now we have EBAEEDF. We need CBCBEBAEEDF.
We are missing CBCB at the beginning. We are stuck.

Let's go back to the start. We have EDFDDBECF.
We want CBCBEBAEEDF.
The only rule that creates CBCBEBAEEDF is rule 4, and it reduces it to "". So we need to create this string.
We are not allowed to use rule 3.

Let's try applying rule 1 first.
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF.
Then applying rule 2.
EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF
Now we have EBAEEDF.

We need to get CBCBEBAEEDF. We are missing CBCB.
We can't insert characters. We can only substitute.

We are stuck.

I'm going to try applying rule 1 twice if possible.

EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF.
I can only apply rule 1 once.

Let's look at the rules again.
1) "CF"->"DF"
2) "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
3) ""->"CB"
4) "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""

We have EDFDDBECF.
We need CBCBEBAEEDF.

EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF (Rule 1)
EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF (Rule 2)

EBAEEDF. We need CBCBEBAEEDF.

I'm stuck.

I need to find a sequence of operations that transforms EDFDDBECF into CBCBEBAEEDF.

Let's try a different tactic. What if we try to work backward from CBCBEBAEEDF?
We need to get to CBCBEBAEEDF.
Before that, we need to apply either rule 1, 2, or 3 to get to CBCBEBAEEDF.
Rule 3 is not an option.

Let's try to apply rule 1.

It seems like applying rule 1 and then 2 is a dead end.

I'm completely stuck.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Sometimes, you need to be creative and look for indirect ways to apply the transitions. Don't get tunnel vision on applying the rules in a straightforward manner. Consider if there's a way to manipulate the string to *enable* a specific transition.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
