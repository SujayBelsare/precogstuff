Okay, John Watson is suggesting that repeated applications of rule 1 might be key, but also questioning if it's even helpful. I was trying to force the creation of "BFBBC" at the beginning, but that might be too restrictive. Let's rethink the overall strategy.

The transitions are:
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

The initial string is "BBBCAFBDEC".

The goal is to reach "".

Let's try to apply rule 1:
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

Now, instead of trying to immediately make "BFBBC", let's see if we can create more "CAFBDEC" substrings. Since we can only modify the *first* match, repeated applications of rule 1 *on the original string* are impossible.

John Watson is hinting that I'm missing something obvious about rule 1. Let's ignore it for now and try to work with the other rules.

We have "BBBCAFBDEC". Let's think about what each rule *creates*:

Rule 2 creates "FEBD".
Rule 3 creates "FFE".
Rule 4 creates "BBC".
Rule 5 requires "BFBBC".

Let's try a different approach. The key is to eliminate "CAFBDEC" without using rule 1, since John Watson is hinting it is useless.

Let's try to build "EBDCA" to apply rule 3.  We have "CAFBDEC".  We want to get "EBDCA".

We are at "BBBCAFBDEC".

If we could somehow get "BBBFBDCA", then we could apply rule 2 to get "BFEBDCA", then use rule 3. But we don't have "BBFFB".

Let's try to find a sequence that ends in rule 5.

... -> BFBBC -> ""

So we want to create "BFBBC". Let's think backwards.

BFBBC can come from:
FFE -> BBC (rule 4). So we want to get "BFFE".
EBDCA -> FFE (rule 3). So we want to get "BEBDCA".
BBFFB -> FEBD (rule 2). So we want to get something to transform into BBFFB.
CAFBDEC -> FFBCA (rule 1). So we want something to transform into CAFBDEC.

Let's try to get "BEBDCA".
We have "BBBCAFBDEC".

It seems like rule 1 is necessary at some point. Let's revisit it.
BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA

Let's try to use rule 2 now on "BBFFB".

BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA -> BFEBDCAFFBCA

Let's use rule 3 on "EBDCA".

BFEBDCAFFBCA -> BFFFEAFFBCA

Let's use rule 4 on "FFE".

BFFFEAFFBCA -> BFBBCAFFBCA

We have "BFBBC" almost, but it's "BFBBCA".

Let's try a different approach. The key is to eliminate "CAFBDEC", maybe by converting it into something else.

BBBCAFBDEC.

Let's try the following:
Apply rule 1: BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA
Apply rule 2: BBBFBCAFFBCA -> BFEBDCAFFBCA
Apply rule 3: BFEBDCAFFBCA -> BFFFEAFFBCA
Apply rule 4: BFFFEAFFBCA -> BFBBCAFFBCA

Let's try to make BBFFB.

BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA

It seems like rule 1 is a dead end. Let's ignore it.

Let's try another approach.

We have "BBBCAFBDEC". Is there a way to create BFBBC without using rule 1?
We need BFBBC -> "".

Let's try the following:
BBBCAFBDEC

Let's call John Watson again.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the interplay between rules 3 and 4. Could these rules be used in succession to simplify the string?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
