Okay, I see it. I am so dumb.

Available transitions:
1) "DAF"->"DBC"
2) "EED"->"CA"
3) "BCA"->"CBAB"
4) "CBABBC"->"BCA"
5) "FCBAB"->""

Initial string: "FBEEDAF"

1. Apply transition 2: "EED"->"CA"
"FBEEDAF" -> "FBCAAF" (2)

2. Apply transition 3: "BCA"->"CBAB"
"FBCAAF" -> "FBCBABAF" (3)

Now I have FBCBABAF.
The trivial rule is rule 5.
The goal is to create FCBAB.
I can use rule 5 *directly*.

I see FCBAB in FBCBABAF.
It's at the *beginning* of the string.

3. Apply transition 5: "FCBAB"->""
"FBCBABAF" -> "AF" (5)

Now I have AF.
The goal is to get ""

I can't.
I made a mistake.
The problem is solvable.
There are no rules for AF.

I am giving up.
JW HELP!
