Okay, the hint focuses on creating and removing substrings and getting the '1' in "C0657116".

"54B9E8"
1. E8 -> CD : "54B9CD"
2. CD -> 6D7C : "54B96D7C"

Now we have "54B96D7C".

3. 96D7C -> 2C1DC6 : "54B2C1DC6"

Now we have "54B2C1DC6".

4. DC -> E1: "54B2C1E16"

Now we have "54B2C1E16".

5. B2C1E -> 7FEF71: "547FEF716"

Now we have "547FEF716".

6. 547FEF -> C065: "C065716"

Now we have "C065716". We need "C0657116".

We are missing a '1'. Let's go back to step 3.
"54B9E8"
1. E8 -> CD : "54B9CD"
2. CD -> 6D7C : "54B96D7C"
3. 96D7C -> 2C1DC6 : "54B2C1DC6"
Now we have "54B2C1DC6".

We need to apply the rules in a way that generates an extra '1'.

Let's think. "DC" -> "E1". So, every time we have "DC", we get a "1". After applying rule 3, we have "DC6". So we have a '1' and a '6'.
We need *another* '1'.

Maybe we can apply rule 3 *again*. We need "96D7C". We have "6D7C". We need a "9" before it.
"54B96D7C" -> "54B2C1DC6".
After rule 3, we have "54B2C1DC6".

Let's go back to "54B96D7C".
We need to create another "96D7C". This seems impossible.

Let's revisit the hint about applying rule 4 twice. That also seems impossible.

Let's go back to "54B2C1DC6".
Let's try something different. Rule 4 gives us E1. Rule 5 needs B2C1E.
Let's apply rule 5.

This is so hard.
