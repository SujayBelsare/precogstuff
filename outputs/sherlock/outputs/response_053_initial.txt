Let's analyze the given problem.
Available transitions:
1) "DAF"->"DBC"
2) "EED"->"CA"
3) "BCA"->"CBAB"
4) "CBABBC"->"BCA"
5) "FCBAB"->""

Initial string: "FBEEDAF"

We want to transform "FBEEDAF" to "".
First, let's try to apply the transitions and see what we get.
FBEEDAF
Applying rule 1 does not work.
Applying rule 2 does not work.
Applying rule 3 does not work.
Applying rule 4 does not work.
Applying rule 5 does not work.

Let's try to get "FCBAB" somehow.
We have "FBEEDAF".
If we apply rule 1, we want to get "DAF".
We have "DAF" at the end.
So "FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC".
Now we want to get "FCBAB".
We can't directly get it.
Let's try to get "CBAB" by using rule 3 "BCA"->"CBAB".
Then we need to get "BCA".
We have "FBEEDBC".
If we apply rule 2, "EED"->"CA", we get "FBCAAF".
This doesn't seem helpful.
Let's try a different approach.

FBEEDAF
FBEEDAF -> FBEEDBC (1)
Let's try to create "CBABBC" using rule 4 "CBABBC"->"BCA".
We have "FBEEDBC".
Let's try to create "BCA" using rule 2 "EED"->"CA".
FBEEDAF -> FBCAAF (2)
This looks promising.
Now we need to create CBAB.
But we can't create CBAB directly.

Let's go back to FBEEDAF.
We want FCBAB.
We have F at the beginning.
Let's try to create CBAB.
CBAB can be created by BCA -> CBAB.
We need BCA.
We can create BCA by EED -> CA.
FBEEDAF -> FBCAAF (2)
This is not good.
Let's try to use rule 1 first.
FBEEDAF -> FBEEDBC (1)
Now we need FCBAB.

If we can create CBABBC, then we can use rule 4 to get BCA.
Then BCA can be used to generate CBAB.
Then FCBAB can be cleared.

FBEEDAF
FBEEDBC (1)
We want to get FCBAB.

If we get BCA, then we can transform it to CBAB.
Then FCBAB is the goal.
So we need to create BCA.
FBEEDAF -> FBEEDBC (1)
FBEEDAF -> FBCAAF (2)

Let's start with FBEEDAF.
FBEEDBC (1)
Let's try to make "FCBAB" from "FBEEDBC".
We need to eliminate "EED".
Let's try to make CBABBC.
FBEEDAF
FBEEDBC (1)
If we can make CBABBC, then we can transform it into BCA.
Maybe this is the key.
FBEEDBC -> FBEEDBC. We need CBABBC.
Let's try another approach.

FBEEDAF
Let's transform DAF into DBC.
FBEEDBC (1)
We want FCBAB.
We can transform BCA into CBAB.
We need to create BCA.
So we need to create EED -> CA.
FBCAAF (2)
This is not good.

Let's try to reach FCBAB.
FBEEDAF
We want to get FCBAB.
We need to make EED into something else.
Let's try to make DAF into DBC.
FBEEDBC (1)
Now we need to get FCBAB.
If we had CBABBC, we can get BCA.
Then CBAB.
FBEEDBC.
FBEEDBC. We need to get rid of EED.
We can't.

Let's analyze backwards.
We need FCBAB.
Then we need to get CBAB by BCA->CBAB.
Then we need to get BCA.
So we need BCA.
How to get BCA?
We can get BCA by CBABBC->BCA.

So we need CBABBC.
We need to get BCA.
FBEEDAF
DAF->DBC
FBEEDBC (1)
EED -> CA
FBCAAF (2)
This is not useful.

Let's try the CBABBC approach.
FBEEDAF -> ? CBABBC.
FBEEDAF
FBEEDBC (1)
Let's see if we can get CBABBC.

FBEEDAF
FBEEDBC (1)

If we get BCA, then we can transform it to CBAB.
If we have CBABBC, we can transform it to BCA.
So we want FCBAB.

Let's try to get BCA.
FBEEDAF
FBCAAF (2)
This is not helpful.

Let's go backwards from FCBAB.
FCBAB
BCA
CBABBC
So we want to get CBABBC.
From FBEEDAF.
FBEEDAF -> FBEEDBC (1)

FBEEDBC
Then what?
