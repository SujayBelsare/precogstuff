Okay, let's analyze the given problem.
Initial string: "13CFE6D3349EC692"
Available transitions:
1) "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
2) "292"->"9F5"
3) "3CFE6"->"A5"
4) "EC9"->"EB"
5) "D3"->"B0"
6) "EB"->"76"
7) "1A5B07E76F5"->""

Let's try to apply the transitions and see where it leads us.
1. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"13CFE6D3349EC692" -> "1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5D3349EC692" -> "1A5B0349EC692"
Now we need to get "1A5B07E76F5". Let's see what we can do.
3. Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B0349EC692" -> "1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply transition 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC292" -> "1A5B037EEC9F5"
We are close. Let's see if we can get an EB using rule 4.
5. Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"
This doesn't appear to work directly. Let's try a different route.

Let's try starting with transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"13CFE6D3349EC692" -> "13CFE6D337EEC292"
Now, we need to generate the "1A5B07E76F5".
Transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"13CFE6D337EEC292" -> "1A5D337EEC292"
Transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5D337EEC292" -> "1A5B037EEC292"
Transition 1 is not helpful.

Let's try a different order again.
Initial string: "13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"13CFE6D3349EC692" -> "1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5D3349EC692" -> "1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B0349EC692" -> "1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply transition 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC292" -> "1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"
It seems impossible to make "EC9" directly.
6. Apply transition 6: "EB"->"76"

Let's try another approach. I'm going to invoke John Watson.
