Okay, John Watson's feedback is crucial. It suggests that applying Rule 5 ("E"->"27") *after* Rule 2 ("9E5"->"B2") might lead to a dead end. This means I need to re-examine the sequence.

Initial string: "167B5D"

1. Apply Rule 1 ("167B"->"9E"): "167B5D" -> "9E5D"

Now the string is "9E5D". Let's analyze the possible next steps:

*   Rule 2 ("9E5"->"B2") can be applied.
*   Rule 5 ("E"->"27") can be applied.

Let's explore applying Rule 5 *before* Rule 2, as the previous solution immediately applies Rule 2:

2. Apply Rule 5 ("E"->"27"): "9E5D" -> "9275D"

Now the string is "9275D". Let's see what rules can be applied:

*   None of the rules seem directly applicable to transform "9275D" into something useful. Rule 6 ("751"->"F5") needs a '1' at the end, and we have 'D'.

So applying Rule 5 before Rule 2 leads to a dead end. Therefore, let's stick to the original plan of applying Rule 2 right after Rule 1.

1. Apply Rule 1 ("167B"->"9E"): "167B5D" -> "9E5D"
2. Apply Rule 2 ("9E5"->"B2"): "9E5D" -> "B2D"

Now the string is "B2D". What can we do?

3. Apply Rule 3 ("B2D"->"A1"): "B2D" -> "A1"

Now the string is "A1".

4. Apply Rule 4 ("A"->"BE5"): "A1" -> "BE51"

Now the string is "BE51".

5. Apply Rule 5 ("E"->"27"): "BE51" -> "B2751"

Now the string is "B2751".

6. Apply Rule 6 ("751"->"F5"): "B2751" -> "B2F5"

Now the string is "B2F5".

7. Apply Rule 7 ("B2F5"-> ""): "B2F5" -> ""

So the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] works.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
