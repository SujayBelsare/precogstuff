Okay, let's start again with a more structured approach. I will focus on trying to get the initial string to match the left-hand side of rule 5, "ABABCFFF".

Initial string: "ECBEFABAED"
Available transitions:
1) "ECBEF"->"EBEB"
2) "ED"->"FF"
3) "ABA"->"CF"
4) "EB"->"AB"
5) "ABABCFFF"->""

ECBEFABAED -> EBEBABAED [1]
Now I want "AB" instead of "EB".
EBEBABAED -> ABABABAED [4, applied twice]
Now I have "ABABABAED". I want "CF" instead of "ABA" in the middle.
ABABABAED -> ABABCFED [3]
Now I want "FF" instead of "ED".
ABABCFFED -> ABABCFFFFF [2]
Now I have "ABABCFFFFF". I want "ABABCFFF".
It seems I am stuck. I will try another approach.

Initial string: "ECBEFABAED"
Available transitions:
1) "ECBEF"->"EBEB"
2) "ED"->"FF"
3) "ABA"->"CF"
4) "EB"->"AB"
5) "ABABCFFF"->""

I want to get to ABABCFFF.
Let's try to work backwards.
ABABCFFF is what I want to get to.
Before that, what could I have?
The transitions I have are ECBEF->EBEB, ED->FF, ABA->CF, EB->AB, ABABCFFF->""

Let's try starting with making the ED into FF first.
ECBEFABAED -> ECBEFABAF [2] This doesn't help. Let's try the initial approach first.

ECBEFABAED -> EBEBABAED [1]
Now, EB -> AB
EBEBABAED -> ABABABAED [4, applied twice]
Now, ABA -> CF
ABABABAED -> ABABCFED [3]
Now, ED -> FF
ABABCFFED -> ABABCFFFFF [2]

I am stuck again.
Let's try a different approach.

ECBEFABAED
I will start with the ABA -> CF transition.
ECBEFABAED -> ECBECFED [3]
Then ED -> FF
ECBECFEF [2]
This also doesn't seem right.

Let's try the original approach one more time, but more carefully.
ECBEFABAED
ECBEF -> EBEB [1]
EBEBABAED
EB -> AB [4, twice]
ABABABAED
ABA -> CF [3]
ABABCFFED
ED -> FF [2]
ABABCFFFFF
I am stuck again.

Let's rethink this. ABABCFFF -> "". I need to get to that.
I have ECBEFABAED.

ECBEF -> EBEB. That seems likely.
Then two EBs become ABs.
Then ABA becomes CF.
Then ED becomes FF.
I always end up with ABABCFFFFF.

Let's try to avoid the ED -> FF for now.
ECBEFABAED
ECBEF -> EBEB [1]
EBEBABAED
EB -> AB [4, twice]
ABABABAED
ABA -> CF [3]
ABABCFFED
I am stuck.

JW HELP!

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the constraints of applying only the first matching substring. Does the order of applying transformations matter?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
