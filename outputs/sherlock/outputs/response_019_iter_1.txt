Okay, let's try applying rule 2 first as John Watson suggested.

Initial string: "DEDCE"

Apply rule 2: "DEC"->"BE"
DEDCE -> BECE

Now we have "BECE". We need to get "BAFDAF". Let's apply rule 3 to both E's.
BECE -> BAFCAFAF

This is still not what we want.

Let's try a different approach.

Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E"->"AF"
DEDCE -> DAFDCE

Now apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
DAFDCE -> DAFCDCE

Apply rule 3 to the last E: "E"->"AF"
DAFCDCE -> DAFCDCFAF

Still not working.

Let's go back to the beginning.

Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 3 to the LAST E: "E"->"AF"
DEDCE -> DEDCAF

Apply rule 2: "DEC"->"BE"
DEDCAF -> BECAF

Apply rule 3 to the E: "E"->"AF"
BECAF -> BAFCAF

Still not the right pattern.

Let's try this.

Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 2: "DEC"->"BE"
DEDCE -> BECE

Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E"->"AF"
BECE -> BAFCF

Apply rule 3 to the last E: "E"->"AF"
BAFCFAF

We are so close. We need a BAFDAF.

Let's try this again.

Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 3 to the last E:
DEDCE -> DEDCAF
Apply rule 2:
DEDCAF -> BECAF
Apply rule 3 to the remaining E
BECAF -> BAFCAF

Let's try this.

Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 2: DEC -> BE
DEDCE -> BECE
Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> AF
BECE -> BAFCE
Apply rule 3 to the last E: E -> AF
BAFCAFAF

This is not working.

Let's try something else.
DEDCE
Rule 3 on the first E: DAFDCE
Rule 1: DAFCDCE
Rule 3 on the last E: DAFCDCFAF

Okay, let's think outside the box.

DEDCE -> BECE (Rule 2)
BECE -> BAFCF (Rule 3)
BAFCF -> BAFCAFAF (Rule 3)

Nope.

DEDCE -> DEDCAF (Rule 3 on last E)
DEDCAF -> BECAF (Rule 2)
BECAF -> BAFCAF (Rule 3 on first E)

Nope.

Let's start with Rule 3 on the first E:
DEDCE -> DAFDCE
Then Rule 1:
DAFDCE -> DAFCDCE
Then Rule 3 on the last E:
DAFCDCE -> DAFCDCFAF

Let's try something different. We need to create "BAFDAF".

DEDCE
Rule 3 on the first E -> DAFDCE
Rule 1: DAFCDCE
Rule 2: NO
Rule 3 on the last E -> DAFCDCFAF

I'm going to use John Watson again.
JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the order of applying rules 1 and 3. Rule 1 moves Cs to the right and Rule 3 turns Es into AFs. How can you strategically use Rule 1 to position Cs so that Rule 3 creates the required AF sequences for Rule 4?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
