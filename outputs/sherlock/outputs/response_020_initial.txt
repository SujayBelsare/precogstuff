Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "CCBDA" and the goal is to reach an empty string using the given transitions:

1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

It's unusual to have a transition that creates a string from an empty string (transition 1). This suggests that we might need to *add* characters strategically to enable the other transitions. Transition 3, "EDEDEDCAA"->"", looks like the main target for elimination. Transition 2, "CBDA"->"AA", seems useful in simplifying the initial string.

Here's my attempt at a solution:

1. **CCBDA -> CCA** (Apply transition 2 to "CBDA")
2. **CCA**

Now, we need to somehow create "EDEDEDCAA" from "CCA". This looks impossible. I'm stuck and will need John Watson's help.

JW HELP!
