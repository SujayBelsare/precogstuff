Okay, I was focusing too much on building "EFEFEFEFDFFA" directly. The feedback suggests re-evaluating the transitions, especially the seemingly useless ones.

Initial string: "DBFFA"
Target string: ""
Available transitions:
1) "DBFF"->"DFF"
2) ""->"EF"
3) "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->""

The key insight is that the only way to get to "" is to apply rule 3. Therefore, we must at some point transform "DBFFA" into "EFEFEFEFDFFA". We need to figure out how to do this.

Let's start by assuming we can somehow get to "EFEFEFEFDFFA". Then we simply apply rule 3 and we are done. The puzzle is solvable.

Now, given "DBFFA", can we get to "EFEFEFEFDFFA"? I don't see how.

I am still missing something.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on the initial string and the available transitions. Can you identify a sequence of transitions, even if it seems to make the string longer initially, that might eventually lead to the target string? Consider the interplay between transitions.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
