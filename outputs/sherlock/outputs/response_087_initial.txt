Okay, let's analyze the problem. The goal is to transform "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" into "". We have a complex final transition (6) that we need to aim for: "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"->""

Initial string: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

Let's try to work backward from the final state. We need to create "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978".

1. "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
We need to introduce "0909" at the beginning. Applying transition 1 twice:
-> "090943CD3DA5DA0A8978"  [1, 1]

2. We have "09094" now. We need "D8D2CDA0A5FF978". Currently, we have "3CD3DA5DA0A8978".
Let's look for ways to create "D8". We have "8" -> "5FF". Also, "F1D3" -> "D8".

Let's try to create the whole target string. We need "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
We have "090943CD3DA5DA0A8978"

First, let's try to get "D8". We need to transform "3CD3DA5DA0A8" to "D8D2CDA0A5FF9".
"3C" -> "F1". Then "F1D3" -> "D8".
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978" -> "4F1D3DA5DA0A8978" [2]
"4F1D3DA5DA0A8978" -> "4D8DA5DA0A8978" [5]
Now we have "09094D8DA5DA0A8978"

We want "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
We have "09094D8DA5DA0A8978"
We need to transform "DA5" to "D2C". "A5" -> "2C".
"09094D8DA5DA0A8978" -> "09094D8D2CDA0A8978" [3]
We want "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"
We have "09094D8D2CDA0A8978"
We need to transform "8" into "5FF9".
"8" -> "5FF".
"09094D8D2CDA0A8978" -> "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978" [4]

Now we have the target!
"09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978" -> "" [6]

So the solution is: [1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]}$STOP
