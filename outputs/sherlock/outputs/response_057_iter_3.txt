Okay, let's analyze the rules and try to group them based on the substrings they transform. The goal is to transform "DAEADCF" to "". The known solution is [3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5].

Available transitions:
1) "EA"->"DD" (EA becomes DD)
2) "DDC"->"ABDED" (DDC becomes ABDED)
3) ""->"BB" (Empty string becomes BB - insertion)
4) "BDEDF"->"CDFDD" (BDEDF becomes CDFDD)
5) "BBBBDADACDFDD"->"" (The entire string becomes empty)

The solution is [3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5]. Let's apply these rules step by step:

1. **DAEADCF -> BDAEADCF** (Rule 3: "" -> BB)
2. **BDAEADCF -> BBDAEADCF** (Rule 3: "" -> BB)
3. **BBDAEADCF -> BBBDAEADCF** (Rule 3: "" -> BB)
4. **BBBDAEADCF -> BBBBDDADCF** (Rule 1: EA -> DD)
5. **BBBBDDADCF -> BBBBDADACDF** (Rule 2: DDC -> ABDED - This requires a closer look.  We need to find a "DDC" substring to apply it. There is no DDC. It seems there's an error in the solution or the problem statement.)
6. **BBBBDADACDF -> BBBBDADACDFDD** (Rule 4: BDEDF -> CDFDD). There is no BDEDF.

Given the solution [3,3,1,2,4,5] and the current status of the string, there is something wrong. Specifically, after we apply rules 3, 3, 1, we get BBBBDDADCF. To apply rule 2, we should find DDC, but there is no DDC.

Since we know the answer, and we're stuck trying to make the transitions work, let's assume Rule 2 is supposed to be applied in a different part of the string. Let us assume there is a typo and instead of DDC, its just DC.

Let us try a different approach. The solution is [3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5].
1. **DAEADCF -> BDAEADCF** (Rule 3)
2. **BDAEADCF -> BBDAEADCF** (Rule 3)
3. **BBDAEADCF -> BBBDAEADCF** (Rule 3)
4. **BBBDAEADCF -> BBBBDDADCF** (Rule 1)

We have BBBBDDADCF.
5. BBBBDDADCF -> Apply DDC -> ABDED. But there is no DDC.
6. Let us assume there is a typo.

Since the answer is [3,3,1,2,4,5], let us re-examine the transitions and the string.
String is "DAEADCF".
1. DAEADCF -> BDAEADCF (Rule 3)
2. BDAEADCF -> BBDAEADCF (Rule 3)
3. BBDAEADCF -> BBBDAEADCF (Rule 3)
4. BBBDAEADCF -> BBBBDDADCF (Rule 1)

We have BBBBDDADCF.
Now, we need to make "DDC" using rule 2. The string doesn't have "DDC".

Let's assume there's a typo in the problem, and the correct rule 2 is "DAD" -> "ACA".
Let us try to get there.
1. DAEADCF -> BDAEADCF (Rule 3)
2. BDAEADCF -> BBDAEADCF (Rule 3)
3. BBDAEADCF -> BBBDAEADCF (Rule 3)
4. BBBDAEADCF -> BBBBDDADCF (Rule 1)

We have BBBBDDADCF.
5. BBBBDDADCF -> Rule 2 is still a problem.

The problem is not solvable with these rules.
