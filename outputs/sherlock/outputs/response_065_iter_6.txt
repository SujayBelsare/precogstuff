Okay, let's try a more systematic approach. I will map out the states and transitions to see if a pattern emerges.

Initial String: "EEFDDBBDFDEF"

Goal: ""

Transitions:
1) "BDF"->"AA"
2) "BAADE"->"EFAA"
3) "E"->"BB"
4) "AF"->"FC"
5) "BBBBFDDEFAFC"->""

Let's start by trying to create the "BBBBFDDEFAFC" pattern, since we know that will lead to the empty string.

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "EEFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
"BBFDDBBDFDBBDF"

We want to create "BBBBFDDEFAFC". We currently have "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF".
Let's try to isolate the "FD" sequences and see if we can manipulate them.

3. BDF -> AA: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF" [1]
"BBAADDBBDFDBBDF"

This isn't immediately helpful. Let's backtrack and try a different opening sequence.

Starting from "EEFDDBBDFDEF" again:

1. E -> BB: "EEFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]

Now we have "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF". We want "BBBBFDDEFAFC".

We need to transform "DDBBDFDBBDF" into "DDEFAFC".
Let's try to get rid of those BDF sequences.

4. BDF -> AA: "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBBBFDDAADFDBBDF" [1]
"BBBBFDDAADFDBBDF"

This is not helpful. Let's try a different approach entirely.

We want "BBBBFDDEFAFC". Let's try working backwards from that goal state.
We need to create "BBBBFDDEFAFC" using our transitions.
The only transition that *creates* it is the final transition (5).
So, we need to get to that state.

Let's try starting with the 'E' -> 'BB' transitions to see where it leads.
"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "EEFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
4. BDF -> AA: "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBBBFDDAADFDBBDF" [1]
5. BDF -> AA: "BBBBFDDAADFDBBDF" -> "BBBBFDDAADAA" [1]

This doesn't seem right.

Let's try focusing on the "BAADE" -> "EFAA" transition. To use this, we need to create "BAADE" somewhere in the string.
Let's start by trying to isolate "DDE".

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "EEFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" -> "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. BDF -> AA: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF" [1]

Now we have "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF". We want a "BAADE" sequence.
If we can somehow get rid of the extra 'D', we might be able to use transition 2.

4. AF -> FC: "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF" -> "BBAADDBBDFDBCDF" [4]

Still not useful. Let's rethink.

Here's a strategy: use the 'E' -> 'BB' rule to create more 'BB' sequences. Then, use 'BDF' -> 'AA' to simplify the expression.

EEFDDBBDFDEF
1. E -> BB: BBFDDBBDFDEF [3]
2. E -> BB: BBFDDBBDFDBBDF [3]
3. BDF -> AA: BBAADDBBDFDBBDF [1]
4. E -> BB: BBAADDBBDFDBBDBBDF [3]
5. BDF -> AA: BBAADDBAADBDBBDBBDF [1]
6. AF -> FC: BBAADDBAADBDBBCDBBDF [4]
7. E -> BB: BBAADDBAADBDBBCDBBBDF [3]
8. AF -> FC: BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBDF [4]
9. BDF -> AA: BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBAA [1]
10. AF -> FC: BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBCCA [4]
11. E -> BB: BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBCCBB [3]

This is not leading anywhere.

Based on John Watson's feedback, I need to focus on creating "BBBBFDDEFAFC".
I also need to consider the 'BAADE' -> 'EFAA' transition.

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. E -> BB: "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
Now we have "BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF".

We need "DDEFAFC".
The transitions we have are:
1) "BDF"->"AA"
2) "BAADE"->"EFAA"
3) "E"->"BB"
4) "AF"->"FC"
5) "BBBBFDDEFAFC"->""

Let's try to manipulate "DDBBDFDBBDF"

4. BDF -> AA: BBBBFDDAADFDBBDF [1]
5. BDF -> AA: BBBBFDDAADAA [1]

This is not helpful.

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. BDF -> AA: "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF" [1]
4. E -> BB: "BBAADDBBDFDBBDBBDF" [3]
5. BDF -> AA: "BBAADDBAADBDBBDBBDF" [1]
6. AF -> FC: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCDBBDF" [4]
7. E -> BB: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCDBBBDF" [3]
8. AF -> FC: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBDF" [4]
9. BDF -> AA: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBAA" [1]
10. AF -> FC: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBCCA" [4]
11. E -> BB: "BBAADDBAADBDBBCCDBBBCCBB" [3]

Still not working.

Let me try to work backward.

We need to get to "BBBBFDDEFAFC".

The last step must be rule 5.

Before that, we might have "BAADE"

Let's try to get "BAADE" somewhere.

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB : "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. BDF -> AA : "BBAADDBDEF" [1]
3. E -> BB: "BBAADDBBBDF" [3]
4. BDF-> AA: "BBAADDBBAA" [1]

Not helping.

EEFDDBBDFDEF

1. E->BB: BBFDDBBDFDEF [3]
2. E->BB: BBBFDDBBDFDEF [3]
3. E->BB: BBBBFDDBBDFDEF [3]
"BBBBFDDBBDFDEF"

Let's try to create the "EFAFC" part.
"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: BBFDDBBDFDEF [3]
2. BDF -> AA: BBAADDBDEF [1]
3. AF->FC: BBAADDBDC [4]

Not going anywhere.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different path.

"EEFDDBBDFDEF"

1. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDEF" [3]
2. E -> BB: "BBFDDBBDFDBBDF" [3]
3. BDF -> AA: "BBAADDBBDFDBBDF" [1]

I am still stuck.
