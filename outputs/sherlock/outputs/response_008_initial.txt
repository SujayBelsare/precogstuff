Okay, let's analyze the problem.

Initial string: "FDBEF"
Transitions:
1) "DBEF"->"FFB"
2) "FF"->"EE"
3) "B"->"CB"
4) "EEFCCB"->""

The goal is to reach an empty string. Let's try to apply the transitions.

FDBEF -> FFFB (Applying rule 1 is not possible because "DBEF" must be at the start)
However, "DBEF" is not present at the beginning.
Let's try to create a "DBEF" sequence. This is impossible.
Let's examine the target, "EEFCCB" and work backwards.

We need to reach "EEFCCB".

Let's try applying rule 1 to the initial string: "FDBEF"
This doesn't work since "DBEF" needs to be at the start.

Let's look for ways to create "EE" and "FF". Rule 2 creates "EE" from "FF". Rule 1 creates "FFB" from "DBEF". So we need to create "DBEF".

FDBEF -> FFFB is not possible.

Let's think step by step.

"FDBEF"

If we could get "DBEF" at the beginning, we could use rule 1. We can't rearrange the letters.

If we apply rule 3 to the "B" in "FDBEF", we get "FDCBEF". This doesn't seem useful.

Let's try to work backward from the final target "EEFCCB". We need to create that sequence.
We can create "EE" from "FF" using rule 2. So we can create "FF" using rule 1.

Let's see. What if the initial "F" is irrelevant?

Let's try applying rule 3 to the B in "FDBEF".
FDBEF -> FDCBEF

That doesn't help.

Let's consider applying rule 1 somehow. We need "DBEF" at the beginning.

What if we can get rid of the "F" at the start? We don't have any rule to do that.

Let's try to focus on getting "EEFCCB".
We have "DBEF" -> "FFB". Then "FF" -> "EE".
So "DBEF" -> "EEB".

The initial string is "FDBEF".
Let's try to apply rule 3 to the last "B".
FDBEF -> FDCBEF. Still not helpful.

Maybe we need to make multiple applications of the rules.

"FDBEF"

If we apply rule 1 (which we can't), we get "FFB".

If we apply rule 3 to "B" we get "CB".

Let's try to see if there's a sequence of substitutions that allows us to reach EEFCCB.

FDBEF

The final string needs to be "EEFCCB".

Let's try to generate "EE" from "FF" using rule 2.
Rule 1: "DBEF" -> "FFB". So if we can get "DBEF", we can get "FFB".

Let's analyze the initial string again: FDBEF

We need to get rid of the "F" in the front. No rules allow us to do this.

Maybe this initial "F" is critical.

JW HELP!
