The goal is to transform "DFBCE" to "".
We have two transitions:
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""

The initial string is "DFBCE". We want to reach "".

The second rule can consume "DFBCE" if we have eight "D"s in front of it. The first rule allows us to add "DD" at the beginning of the string.

DFBCE -> DDDFBCE -> DDDDDFBCE -> DDDDDDFBCE -> DDDDDDDDFBCE -> DDDDDDDDDDFBCE -> ""

The sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2].

```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
```

Reasoning:
The initial string is "DFBCE". The target is "". The available rules are ""->"DD" and "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->"". We need to transform the initial string to "DDDDDDDDDFBCE". Each application of rule 1 adds "DD" to the beginning of the string. We repeatedly apply rule 1 until we have eight "D"s at the beginning of the string, which will look like "DDDDDDDDDFBCE". Then we apply rule 2 to reduce the string to "".
