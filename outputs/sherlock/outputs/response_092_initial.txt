Let's analyze the problem. We are given the initial string "3EDC5" and a set of transitions. The goal is to transform the initial string into an empty string. Let's trace the possible transformations.

1. "3EDC5" -> Applying rule 1 "3E"->"94", we get "94DC5".
2. "94DC5" -> Applying rule 2 "4DC5"->"91", we get "991".
3. "991" -> Applying rule 3 "99"->"334C6", we get "334C61".
4. "334C61" -> Applying rule 6 "1"->"4E", we get "334C64E".
Now we want to get to "A534C64E" to use rule 7.
5. "334C64E" -> Applying rule 5 "EE3"->"A5" is not possible, however if we had "EE3" we could apply.
We need to find a way to introduce "EE". Rule 4 allows us to insert "EE" into an empty string.
However, we don't have an empty string.
Let's review our transitions.
1) "3E"->"94"
2) "4DC5"->"91"
3) "99"->"334C6"
4) ""->"EE"
5) "EE3"->"A5"
6) "1"->"4E"
7) "A534C64E"->""

Initial string: "3EDC5"

Let's try a different approach.
"3EDC5"
1. "3EDC5" -> "94DC5" (Rule 1)
2. "94DC5" -> "991" (Rule 2)
3. "991" -> "334C61" (Rule 3)
4. "334C61" -> "334C64E" (Rule 6)
Now we have "334C64E". We need to introduce "A5" before "34C64E".
We have rule 5 "EE3"->"A5". We need to get "EE3" somehow.
From "334C64E", it's not clear how to get "EE3".
The final rule is "A534C64E"->"".
We have "334C64E".

Let's try another approach. If we could get "34C64E", then we would need "A5" before it.
If we start with "3EDC5", we can apply rules 1 and 2 to get "991".
Then rule 6 to get "994E".
Then apply rule 3 to get "334C64E".

Let's analyze what we need to get "A5". We need "EE3".
Where can we get "EE"? Rule 4 gives us "".
So we need to reduce everything to "".

Let's retrace:
"3EDC5" -> "94DC5" (Rule 1)
"94DC5" -> "991" (Rule 2)
"991" -> "334C61" (Rule 3)
"334C61" -> "334C64E" (Rule 6)

We need to somehow introduce "A5" before "34C64E". "EE3" goes to "A5".
