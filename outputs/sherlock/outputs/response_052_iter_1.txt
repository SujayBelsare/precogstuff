Okay, let's try working backward from the goal. The goal is to reach "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE" so we can apply transition 6. The initial string is "ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF".

We need to transform "ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF" into "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE". Let's analyze the differences.

Initial: ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF
Goal: ACDFDBEBAFFAAE

Differences:
1. "E" becomes "B" at index 5.
2. "ABBCBCFFDDF" becomes "EBAFFAAE".

Let's focus on transforming "DEBABBCBCFFDDF" into "DBEBAFFAAE".

The available transitions are:
1) "AB"->"EF"
2) "EFBCBCF"->"AFDB"
3) "DBFDDF"->"FADA"
4) "DA"->"AE"
5) "E"->"BE"
6) "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE"->""

Let's try to apply transition 5 to the initial string:
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF [5]
Now we have "ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF". We want "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE".
We need to transform "BABBCBCFFDDF" into "BAFFAAE".

Let's try applying transition 1 to "AB" in "ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF":
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF [1]
Now we have "EFBBCBCFFDDF". We want "EBAFFAAE".
Let's apply transition 2 to "EFBCBCF":
ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDFAFDBFDDF [2]
Now we have "ACDFDFAFDBFDDF". We want "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE".
We need to transform "DFAFDBFDDF" into "DBEBAFFAAE".

Let's try applying transition 5 to the initial string "ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF":
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF [5]
Now we need to transform "BABBCBCFFDDF" into "BAFFAAE".

Let's focus on "BABBCBCFFDDF" and "BAFFAAE".
"BBCBCFFDDF" needs to become "FFAAE".
Let's try to apply transition 1 to "AB" in the original string:
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF [1]
Now apply transition 2:
ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDFAFDBFDDF [2]
Now apply transition 3:
ACDFDFAFDBFDDF -> ACDFDFAFDADA [3]
Now apply transition 4:
ACDFDFAFDADA -> ACDFDFAFDAE [4]
ACDFDFAFDAE -> ACDFDFAFAEAE [4]
Now apply transition 5:
ACDFDFAFAEAE -> ACDFDFAFBEAE [5]
ACDFDFAFBEAE -> ACDFDFAFBEBE [5]

This is getting nowhere. Let's try a different approach.
We need to get "ACDFDBEBAFFAAE" from "ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF".
Let's apply transition 5 to "E":
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF [5]
Now we have "ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF".
We need to get "BAFFAAE" from "BABBCBCFFDDF".

Let's look at transition 2: EFBCBCF -> AFDB
If we had EFBCBCF, it would turn into AFDB.
We have BBCBCF in the original. We need to get EF.
We can get EF from AB using rule 1.
So apply rule 1:
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF [1]
Now apply rule 2:
ACDFDEEFBBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDFAFDBFDDF [2]
Now apply rule 3:
ACDFDFAFDBFDDF -> ACDFDFAFDADA [3]
Now apply rule 4 twice:
ACDFDFAFDADA -> ACDFDFAFDAE [4]
ACDFDFAFDAE -> ACDFDFAFAEAE [4]
Now apply rule 5:
ACDFDFAFAEAE -> ACDFDFAFBEAE [5]
ACDFDFAFBEAE -> ACDFDFAFBEBE [5]
Still not working.

Let's start again with ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF. We need to get to ACDFDBEBAFFAAE.

Apply rule 5:
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF [5]
We now have ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF and need to get ACDFDBEBAFFAAE.
So we need to transform BABBCBCFFDDF into BAFFAAE.
Apply rule 1:
ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBEFBCBCFFDDF [1]
Apply rule 2:
ACDFDBEBEFBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBAFDBFDDF [2]
Apply rule 3:
ACDFDBEBAFDBFDDF -> ACDFDBEBAFFADA [3]
Apply rule 4:
ACDFDBEBAFFADA -> ACDFDBEBAFFAAE [4]

So the sequence is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4].

```
ACDFDEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF [5]
ACDFDBEBABBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBEFBCBCFFDDF [1]
ACDFDBEBEFBCBCFFDDF -> ACDFDBEBAFDBFDDF [2]
ACDFDBEBAFDBFDDF -> ACDFDBEBAFFADA [3]
ACDFDBEBAFFADA -> ACDFDBEBAFFAAE [4]
```
Now we have ACDFDBEBAFFAAE. We can apply rule 6:
ACDFDBEBAFFAAE -> "" [6]

So the complete sequence is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6].

FINAL ANSWER: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
STOP
