Okay, I am not giving up. I need to look at rule 1 and how it can set up the transformations. I also need to remember that I need a 7 at some point.

Initial String: "BBA23"
Target String: "9797CE83"
Transitions:
1) ""->"97"
2) "7BBA2"->"4F"
3) "94F"->"78"
4) "7"->"CE"
5) "9797CE83"->""

1. The initial string is "BBA23". We can ignore the 3.
2. We need to create "9797CE83".
3. Rule 1: ""->"97". This means if we can reduce the string to empty, we can add "97".

Let's assume we can reduce "BBA2" to "". Then we can add "97". Then we will have "97". We need "9797CE83".

This means we need to find a way to get rid of "BBA2". And then use rule 1 repeatedly and rule 4.

We need "7BBA2" to use rule 2. We can't get a 7 before "BBA2".

Let's try a different approach.

I am still stuck.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're so close! You need to find a way to *use* rule 1. It seems impossible to use it directly on the initial string, but think about what happens if you can transform "BBA23" into something that *allows* you to use rule 1. How can you manipulate the string to create an opportunity to apply rule 1, even if it seems counterintuitive?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).

Initial String: "BBA23"
Target String: "9797CE83"
Transitions:
1) ""->"97"
2) "7BBA2"->"4F"
3) "94F"->"78"
4) "7"->"CE"
5) "9797CE83"->""

1.  We have "BBA23".
2.  Rule 1: "" -> "97" - can only use on empty string.
3.  Rule 2: "7BBA2" -> "4F" - need a "7" before "BBA2".
4.  Rule 3: "94F" -> "78" - need "94F".
5.  Rule 4: "7" -> "CE" - need a "7".
6.  Rule 5: "9797CE83" -> "" - target.

This is it!

Here's the Solution:

1.  We can ignore the 3.
2.  To use rule 1 we need an empty string.
3.  Let's find a way to create a 7.

We need to transform BBA2 into "" to use rule 1.
But we need "7BBA2" to go to "4F".

Okay, here's the trick: there is no solution! You cannot transform "BBA23" into "9797CE83" using the transitions.

No solution.
