Okay, I understand. The goal is to transform "AFCAE" into an empty string using the given transitions:

1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

Let's analyze this carefully. Transition 2 requires the string "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". We can only add "BC" using transition 1. The initial string is "AFCAE". To get to "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" from "AFCAE", we need to add "BCBCBCBC" *before* "AFCAE". This requires applying transition 1 four times.

So the solution is:

AFCAE -> BCAFCAE (1)
BCAFCAE -> BCBCAFCAE (1)
BCBCAFCAE -> BCBCBCAFCAE (1)
BCBCBCAFCAE -> BCBCBCBCAFCAE (1)

Now we have "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" and can apply rule 2.

BCBCBCBCAFCAE -> "" (2)

The solution is thus [1, 1, 1, 1, 2].
