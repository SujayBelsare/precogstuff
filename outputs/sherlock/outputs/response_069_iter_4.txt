Okay, I need to try a different approach for building the target string from scratch.
I need to get to "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB". I will try backtracking.

The last rule must be Rule 4: "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""
So the string before Rule 4 must be "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

Now, let's try to get "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" from "BFEFCCDCADC"

The transitions are:
1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

"BFEFCCDCADC"

I need to get "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

First, apply Rule 1 to "DCADC"
"BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Then apply Rule 2 to the first C: BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
Apply Rule 2 to the second C: BFEFBDBBDEBCC [2]
Apply Rule 3 to BDEBCC BFEFBDBBEEDCCB [3]
Apply Rule 4 to BFEFBDBDEEDCCB

I need to get BFEFBDBDEEDCCB

"BFEFCCDCADC"

Apply Rule 1 BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Apply Rule 2 to the second C
"BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]

We need to get BDEBCC
We are at CBDBEBCC

That's not going to work

Okay

"BFEFCCDCADC"

We need to get BFEFBDBDEEDCCB
Apply Rule 1 "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

We need to get BDB

apply Rule 2 to the third C
BFEFCBCEBDD

That's not right

We need to get "BDEBCC"

"BFEFCBCEBCC"

How can we get BDEBCC

Apply Rule 2 to the first C
BFEFBBDBEBCC

Apply Rule 2 to the second C in BBDBEBCC
BFEFBDBBDEBCC

Apply Rule 3
"BFEFBDBBEEDCCB" [3]

No

BFEFCCDCADC [Initial]
BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
BFEFBDBBDEBCC [2]
BFEFBDBBEEDCCB [3]

"BFEFBDBBEEDCCB"

"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

We need BDEBCC

We are at BBDBEBCC

What if we did BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Then Apply Rule 2 to the *second* C

BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]
"BFEFCBDBEBCC"

Apply Rule 3
There is no BDEBCC

"BFEFCCDCADC"

We need to try something else
Okay, I know the last step is Rule 4. So I need to get to "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

Let's try to work backward

"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"
Apply Rule 3 *backwards*

EEDCCB -> BDEBCC
So if we had BFEFBDBBDEBCC then we can get BFEFBDBDEEDCCB

So we need to get BFEFBDBBDEBCC

We apply Rule 2 *Backwards*
"C"->"BD"
We need to find a C and replace it with BD

If we have BFEFCBCEBCC

Apply Rule 2 to the *first* C

BFEFBBDBEBCC

How can we get BFEFBDBBDEBCC from BFEFBBDBEBCC
Okay. We need BDEBCC

So we need BDEBCC -> EEDCCB using Rule 3

So we need to find a BDEBCC

"BFEFCCDCADC"

Lets Apply Rule 1
BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

We need to find BDEBCC

BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
Apply Rule 2 to the first C
BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]

How can we get BDEBCC

BFEFBBDBEBCC

Apply Rule 2 to the *second* C in BBDBEBCC

BFEFBDBBDEBCC [2]

Then apply Rule 3
BFEFBDBBEEDCCB [3]

I am not getting anywhere

Let me try something else

"BFEFCCDCADC"

Apply Rule 1

BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Apply Rule 2 to the *second* C

BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]

We need to get to BDEBCC

We need to get to BFEFBDBDEEDCCB
"BFEFCBDBEBCC"

How can we get BDEBCC

We need to get BDEBCC

BFEFCBDBEBCC

BFEFCCDCADC

I can't
