Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "BFCCA" to "".

Available transitions:
1) "CA"->"FD"
2) "FD"->"FB"
3) "B"->"FE"
4) "EFCF"->"DC"
5) "FDCFE"->""

Initial string: "BFCCA"

Let's start by applying the rules sequentially and see where it leads.

BFCCA -> Rule 1 can be applied to "CA".
BFCCA -> BFFD (Applying rule 1)

Now we have "BFFD". Let's see what can be applied to it.

BFFD -> Rule 2 can be applied to "FD".
BFFD -> BFFB (Applying rule 2)

Now we have "BFFB". Let's see what can be applied to it.

BFFB -> Rule 3 can be applied to the first "B".
BFFB -> FEFFB (Applying rule 3)

Now we have "FEFFB". This doesn't seem to lead anywhere useful. Let's backtrack and try a different approach from the beginning.

Initial string: BFCCA

Let's apply rule 3 to the initial "B".

BFCCA -> FECCA (Applying rule 3)

Now we have "FECCA". Let's apply rule 1 to "CA".

FECCA -> FEFD (Applying rule 1)

Now we have "FEFD". This also doesn't seem promising.

Let's try to work backwards. We want to reach "FDCFE" to apply rule 5. Let's think what can lead to "FDCFE".

We can get "DC" using rule 4 "EFCF"->"DC". So we want to reach "F(EFCF)FE".
Let's think about how to create EFCF.

Initial string: BFCCA

Let's try converting "CA" to "FD" first.
BFCCA -> BFFD (Rule 1)

Now let's convert the first "B" to "FE".
BFFD -> FEFFD (Rule 3)

Then "FD" to "FB".
FEFFD -> FEFFB (Rule 2)

Then "B" to "FE" again.
FEFFB -> FEFFE (Rule 3)

This also doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

Let's try a different approach.

BFCCA
Apply rule 3 to the first "B": FECCA
Apply rule 1 to "CA": FEFD

Apply rule 2 to "FD": FEFB

Now we have FEFB.

Let's try starting with rule 1:
BFCCA -> BFFD

Then rule 2:
BFFD -> BFFB

Then rule 3:
BFFB -> FEFFB

Let's look for combinations that can lead to rule 5.

We need FDCFE.

Let's try starting with rule 3.
BFCCA -> FECCA
Then rule 1
FECCA -> FEFD
Then rule 2
FEFD -> FEFB. This isn't right

Let's start with 1.
BFCCA -> BFFD.
Let's try to make FDCFE from here.

Let's start from the end. FDCFE -> "" (Rule 5)
EFCF -> DC (Rule 4)
CA -> FD (Rule 1)
FD -> FB (Rule 2)
B -> FE (Rule 3)

BFCCA
1) CA -> FD. BFCCA -> BFFD
2) B -> FE. BFFD -> FEFFD
3) FD -> FB. FEFFD -> FEFFB
4) B -> FE. FEFFB -> FEFFE

It seems very hard to get to the required form.
