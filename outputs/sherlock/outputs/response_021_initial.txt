Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "DAABCCB", and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions:

1) "CCB"->"CC"
2) ""->"BF"
3) "BFBFBFDAABCC"->""

The final transition is very specific and long, so we should aim to create that substring.

Let's try to build the target string "BFBFBFDAABCC" from "DAABCCB". We need to insert "BFBFBF" before "DAABCC".

"DAABCCB"

The only applicable rule initially is rule 1: "CCB"->"CC". Applying this gives us:

"DAABCCB" -> "DAABCC" [1]

Now we have "DAABCC". We need to prepend "BFBFBF". The only way to add "BF" is using rule 2: ""->"BF". However, this rule adds "BF" to the *beginning* of the string.

""->"BF"
"DAABCC" -> "BFDAABCC" [2]

We need two more "BF" sequences.
"BFDAABCC" -> "BFBFDAABCC" [2]
"BFBFDAABCC" -> "BFBFBFDAABCC" [2]

Now the string is "BFBFBFDAABCC". We can apply rule 3:
"BFBFBFDAABCC"->"" [3]

So the solution is: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}$
