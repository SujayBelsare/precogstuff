John Watson provided the following feedback:
You are circling around the correct solution. Focus on creating the "4BDA72" part of the target string first. You have the "A72" part already. The "4BD" comes from rule 6, which adds "4BD" to an empty string. This means you need to somehow eliminate "8DB0EA3550" from the initial string "A728DB0EA3550". Think about how the transitions can help you achieve this.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).

Okay, I understand now. The key is to realize that "4BD" comes from rule 6, which adds "4BD" to an empty string. This implies that I need to first eliminate "A728DB0EA3550" down to an empty string, then use rule 6 to create "4BD", and then transform "4BD" and "A72" (which is already there), to "4BDA72C81C834". This seems impossible.

The correct approach is to transform "A728DB0EA3550" into "4BDA72C81C834", *without* using rule 6. We have "A72" already, and "4BD" needs to appear *before* "A72".

So, the goal is to transform "8DB0EA3550" into "4BDA72C81C834".

A728DB0EA3550

Let's focus on the target string "4BDA72C81C834". We have the "A72". We need to create "4BD" *before* the "A72".
We also know that C8 is at index 6, and C83 is at index 8.

Let's try to eliminate parts of the string.
We can use rule 1 to change "3550" to "883".
We can use rule 2 to change "B0EA" to "1E".

We need to get "4BDA72".

A728DB0EA3550

1. Apply rule 2: A728D1E3550. (B0EA -> 1E)

Now we need to transform "8D1E3550" to "4BDA72C81C834". This does not seem correct. We didn't get "4BD".

Let's try to use Rule 1 first.
A728DB0EA3550
1. Apply rule 1: A728DB0EA883

Now we have A728DB0EA883.
We need to transform "8DB0EA883" to "4BDA72C81C834".

Let's backtrack.
"4BDA72C81C834".
We know that "C8" is created by "8D".
We know that "C83" is created by "E6".
So, "8D" needs to come before "E6".

A728DB0EA3550
1. Apply rule 2: A728D1E3550 (B0EA -> 1E)
2. Apply rule 1: A728D1E883 (3550 -> 883)
3. Apply rule 4: A728D1E64 (883 -> 64)
4. Apply rule 5: A728D1C834 (E6 -> C83)

Now we have A728D1C834. This is close, but incorrect. We want "4BDA72C81C834".

A728DB0EA3550
1. Apply rule 1: A728DB0EA883 (3550 -> 883)
2. Apply rule 2: A728D1E883 (B0EA -> 1E)
3. Apply rule 4: A728D1E64 (883 -> 64)
4. Apply rule 5: A728D1C834 (E6 -> C83)

We have A728D1C834. This is still incorrect.

Let's try to get "8D" to "C8" first.

A728DB0EA3550
1. Apply rule 2: A728D1E3550 (B0EA -> 1E)
2. Apply rule 3: A72C81E3550 (8D -> C8)
3. Apply rule 1: A72C81E883 (3550 -> 883)
4. Apply rule 4: A72C81E64 (883 -> 64)
5. Apply rule 5: A72C81C834 (E6 -> C83)

We have A72C81C834. Still not correct.

A728DB0EA3550

We need "4BDA72". We have "A72". We need "4BD" right after.
We need to somehow transform "8DB0EA3550" into "4BDA72C81C834".

I'm stuck.
