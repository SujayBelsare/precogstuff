FFADA->FFAFDA->""
[1, 2]
Reasoning:
The initial string is "FFADA". We need to convert it to an empty string.
First, we can apply rule 1: "A"->"AF". This changes "FFADA" to "FFAFDA".
Then, we can apply rule 2: "FFAFFFFDA"->"". However, we only have "FFAFDA". This seems impossible.

Let's rethink. The goal is to get "FFAFFFFDA". We can only modify the first match.

FFADA -> FFAFDA (rule 1)
Now we have FFAFDA.

We can apply rule 2 to "FFAFFFFDA" which gives us "".
We need to somehow turn FFAFDA into FFAFFFFDA.
We only have "A"->"AF".
FFAFDA -> FFAFFFDA (rule 1)
FFAFFFDA -> FFAFFFFDA (rule 1)

So the correct solution is [1, 1, 1, 2]
FFADA -> FFAFDA -> FFAFFFDA -> FFAFFFFDA -> ""
[1, 1, 1, 2]
