Okay, I will meticulously verify each transition, step by step, starting from the initial string "A031B5".

1. **Initial string:** "A031B5"
2. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "A031B5" becomes "6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
3. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "6AA031B5" becomes "6A6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
4. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "6A6AA031B5" becomes "6A6A6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
5. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "6A6A6AA031B5" becomes "6A6A6A6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
6. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "6A6A6A6AA031B5" becomes "6A6A6A6A6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
7. **Apply rule 1:** "" -> "6A". This inserts "6A" at the beginning of the string.
   - "6A6A6A6A6AA031B5" becomes "6A6A6A6A6A6AA031B5"
   - Transition: 1
8. **Apply rule 2:** "6A6A6A6A6A6AA031B5" -> "". This transforms the string into an empty string.
   - "6A6A6A6A6A6AA031B5" becomes ""
   - Transition: 2

The sequence of transitions is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}$STOP
