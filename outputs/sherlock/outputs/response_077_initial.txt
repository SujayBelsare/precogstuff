Okay, let's analyze this problem. The initial string is "B7FCD61" and the goal is to transform it into "".

Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

The target string for the last rule is "9418FA7394B7FCD08". Our initial string is "B7FCD61".

Let's try to work backward from the target string of rule 4. To get "9418FA7394B7FCD08", we need to introduce "94", "18FA73", "94", "B7FCD", and "08".

Our initial string is "B7FCD61". We can apply rule 1 to get "B7FCD08". Now we need to get "9418FA7394".

We can't directly apply rule 2. Let's see if we can work towards rule 3.
We need "9494" to apply rule 3. We can insert "94" twice using rule 2. However, rule 2 only applies to the empty string.

Let's rethink the approach. The final step must be rule 4. To reach rule 4, the string must be "9418FA7394B7FCD08". We have "B7FCD61".

1. Apply rule 1: "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
Now we need "9418FA7394" to appear before "B7FCD08".

This looks very difficult.
