Let's start with the initial string "ABEBC". We want to reach the empty string "". The available transitions are:
1) "EBC"->"CCA"
2) "C"->"FD"
3) "ABFD"->"FC"
4) "FFDFDA"->""

Let's try applying the rules:
1. Apply rule 1 to "ABEBC": ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Apply rule 2 to the first C in "ACCA": ACCA -> AFDA
3. We want "ABFD" to apply rule 3, but we have "AFDA". Let's try a different path.

Let's analyze the target "FFDFDA". We need to create this substring somehow.
We have "ABEBC".
1. Apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Apply rule 2 to both Cs: ACCA -> AFDFDA
3. We have "AFDFDA". Now, we need an "F" at the beginning.
Let's try another approach.

Start: ABEBC
1. Rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Rule 2 (twice): ACCA -> AFDFDA
Now we need to transform AFDFDA to FFDFDA. This seems difficult. Let's backtrack.

Start: ABEBC
Let's try to create an "ABFD" sequence to apply rule 3. We have "AB" at the start. We need "FD" after that. To get "FD", we need a "C".
We can use rule 1 to turn "EBC" into "CCA". So, we have "ABEBC".

1. Rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Rule 2 (apply to first C): ACCA -> AFDA
This doesn't seem to help us create an "ABFD".

Let's try a different approach. Look at the final rule: "FFDFDA"->""
We want to create "FFDFDA".
We start with "ABEBC".

If we apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
We need to somehow change "ACCA" into "FFDFDA". It seems impossible.

Let's think step by step. We want to reach FFDFDA.
The last step must be rule 4.
What can lead to FFDFDA?

We have ABEBC.
1. Rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
2. Rule 2 (x2): ACCA -> AFDFDA
This almost gives us FFDFDA.
We need to turn the first A into F.
However, we cannot do that.

Let's try to use rule 3. We need "ABFD".
We have "ABEBC".
1. Apply rule 1: ABEBC -> ACCA
Now we have ACCA. We need to create "ABFD".

Let's try a breadth-first search approach.
Start: ABEBC
1. Rule 1: ACCA
From ACCA:
2. Rule 2 (first C): AFDA
3. Rule 2 (second C): AFDFDA
From AFDA:
No rules apply.
From AFDFDA:
No rules apply.

Let's try a different strategy.
We want to create FFDFDA.
Let's try to work backward.
FFDFDA <- ? <- ? <- ABEBC

Maybe we need to create multiple "C"s.
ABEBC -> ACCA -> AFDFDA
1. ABEBC -> ACCA
2. C -> FD
ACCA -> AFDFDA
We want FFDFDA.

Let's try:
ABEBC -> ACCA
ACCA -> AFDFDA
We need an F at the beginning.
Let's go back to ABEBC.

ABEBC
Rule 1: ACCA
Rule 2: AFDFDA
Rule 4: FFDFDA -> ""

Let's try another approach.
ABEBC
Let's try applying rule 2 first. But rule 2 applies to C only.

JW HELP!
