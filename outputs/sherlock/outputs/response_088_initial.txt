Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "DDC31FC" and we want to reduce it to "".

Available transitions:
1) "C31FC"->"EA27C"
2) "DEA2"->"1DA"
3) ""->"5B9"
4) "C"->"00"
5) "5B"->"7E"
6) "7E95B9D1DA700"->""

Let's try applying the rules and see where it leads.

"DDC31FC"

First, we can apply rule 1 to transform "C31FC" into "EA27C":
"DDEA27C"

Now we see "DEA2" in the string. Applying rule 2, "DEA2"->"1DA":
"DD1DA7C"

We want to get to "7E95B9D1DA700". We have "D1DA". Let's try to get the rest of the string to match. We need "7E95B9" before "D1DA" and "700" after it.

Let's apply rule 4 to transform "C" into "00":
"DD1DA700"

Now we need to obtain "7E95B9" before "D1DA". This looks difficult. Let's try a different approach. Rule 3 introduces "5B9" which can be transformed into "7E9". Let's see if we can create a situation where we can make use of rule 6.

The target string is "7E95B9D1DA700". We have the transformations:
"C31FC"->"EA27C"
"DEA2"->"1DA"
""->"5B9"
"C"->"00"
"5B"->"7E"

Initial string: "DDC31FC"

1. Apply rule 1: "DDC31FC" -> "DDEA27C"
2. Apply rule 4 to C: "DDEA27C" -> "DDEA2700"
Now we need to somehow create "7E95B9D1DA700" from "DDEA2700".
This still looks difficult.

Let's consider working backward from the final string "7E95B9D1DA700".
Before applying rule 6, we need "7E95B9D1DA700". We can achieve "D1DA" from "DEA2" using rule 2. We can achieve "7E" from "5B" using rule 5. We can introduce "5B9" from "" using rule 3.

Let's start again.
Initial string: "DDC31FC"
1. Apply rule 1: "DDC31FC" -> "DDEA27C"
2. Apply rule 4: "DDEA27C" -> "DDEA2700"

We want "7E95B9D1DA700". We have "DEA2" -> "1DA", and "C" -> "00", and "5B" -> "7E".
We want to create "7E95B9" before "D1DA". This seems very difficult.
