Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "ADDFD"
Available transitions:
1) "DFD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"BE"
3) "ADFBBBE"->""

First, let's try applying rule 1:
ADDFD -> ADFE

Now, we have ADFE. We need to somehow get to "ADFBBBE".
Let's apply rule 2 to E:
ADFE -> ADFBE

Now, we have ADFBE. Apply rule 2 again:
ADFBE -> ADFBBE

Now, we have ADFBBE. Apply rule 2 again:
ADFBBE -> ADFBBBE

Now, we have ADFBBBE, which we can reduce to "" using rule 3.

So, the solution is:
ADDFD -> ADFE -> ADFBE -> ADFBBE -> ADFBBBE -> ""
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Reasoning:
1. Apply rule 1 "DFD"->"FE" to "ADDFD" resulting in "ADFE".
2. Apply rule 2 "E"->"BE" to "ADFE" resulting in "ADFBE".
3. Apply rule 2 "E"->"BE" to "ADFBE" resulting in "ADFBBE".
4. Apply rule 2 "E"->"BE" to "ADFBBE" resulting in "ADFBBBE".
5. Apply rule 3 "ADFBBBE"->"" to "ADFBBBE" resulting in "".

Final Answer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
