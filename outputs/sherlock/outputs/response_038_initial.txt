Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "EADCF", and we need to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "F"->"EA"
2) "CEA"->"AFBCBD"
3) "EA"->"BF"
4) "FDA"->"CD"
5) "BCDEABCBD"->""

Initial string: "EADCF"

Let's try to apply the transitions:

1. Apply transition 1 to "F": "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
2. Apply transition 3 to "EA": "EADCEA" -> "ADCBF" - This is a dead end as we can't see anything to apply next.
3. Apply transition 1 to "F": "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
4. Apply transition 3 to "EA": "EADCEA" -> "ADCBF"
5. Apply transition 1 to "F" in "EADCF": EADCF -> EADCEA
6. Apply transition 3 to "EA" in "EADCEA": EADCEA -> ADCBF. This looks like a dead end. Let's try something else.

Let's consider if we can create the string in transition 5. The final string needs to be "BCDEABCBD".

1. Apply transition 1 to "F": "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
2. Apply transition 3 to "EA": "EADCEA" -> "ADCBF"
This doesn't look promising.

Let's try to create "CEA" to apply transition 2. We have "EADCF".

1. Apply transition 1 to "F": "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
Now we have "EADCEA".
2. We have "EA" in "EADCEA". Apply transition 3: "EADCEA" -> "ADCBF". Doesn't work.

Let's try another approach.
We need to somehow get to "BCDEABCBD".

Let's try applying transition 1 repeatedly to eliminate "F".
1. "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
2. Now, we have "EADCEA". Let's apply transition 3 to "EA": "EADCEA" -> "ADCBF". Not useful.

Let's go back to "EADCF".
1. Apply transition 1: "EADCF" -> "EADCEA"
2. Apply transition 2? We need "CEA". We have "EA".

Let's think backwards. We want to get to "BCDEABCBD".
Can we get there from transition 2?
Transition 2: "CEA"->"AFBCBD"

Let's start with "EADCF":
1. Apply transition 1: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. Apply transition 3: EADCEA -> ADCBF. Not useful.

Let's go back to EADCF:
1. F -> EA. EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF. EADCEA -> ADCBF. Not useful.

Let's go back to EADCF.
1. F -> EA. EADCF -> EADCEA
2. CEA -> AFBCBD. We don't have CEA

Let's think backwards.
BCDEABCBD -> "" using rule 5.
We need to get to BCDEABCBD.

Let's try a different path.
"EADCF".
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF: EADCEA -> ADCBF
3. We need to find something that creates CDEABCBD.

Let's try a more methodical approach.
1. EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
2. Now, we have EADCEA. We can apply either EA->BF or CEA->AFBCBD.

Let's try to manipulate EADCEA.
We want to get to BCDEABCBD.

Let's try another route.
EADCF.
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA. (1)
2. We can apply EA -> BF. EADCEA -> ADCBF.
3. Now we have ADCBF. This looks terrible.

Let's go back to EADCF.
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
Now we have EADCEA.

The key is to find a way to generate BCDEABCBD.
Let's try another strategy.

EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
We have EADCEA.
2. EA -> BF: EADCEA -> ADCBF. This is likely not the path.

Let's try to get CEA.
EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
Now we have EADCEA.

Let's look for something that produces 'BCDEABCBD'.
CEA -> AFBCBD. We want BCDEABCBD.

Let's try applying 1 repeatedly.
EADCF -> EADCEA -> EADBF (?)

EADCF
1. F -> EA : EADCF -> EADCEA
2. We could use EA -> BF: EADCEA -> ADCBF

Or we can try creating CEA to use CEA -> AFBCBD.

Let's try EADCF.

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
EADCEA -> ADCBF (3)
Dead end.

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
We have EADCEA.
If we could get CEA, we could use rule 2.

Let's try to apply rule 4: FDA -> CD
We need FDA. EADCF. No FDA.

Let's think backwards.
We need BCDEABCBD -> ""
How can we get BCDEABCBD?
CEA -> AFBCBD

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)

EADCF

1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF: EADCEA -> ADCBF.

Let's analyze. We have EADCF.

EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF : EADCEA -> ADCBF.

Let's try another approach.
EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. CEA -> AFBCBD. We need CEA.

Let's rethink. We have EADCF. We want to get to BCDEABCBD.
F -> EA
CEA -> AFBCBD
EA -> BF
FDA -> CD
BCDEABCBD -> ""

EADCF
1. F -> EA : EADCF -> EADCEA
2. We want to get to BCDEABCBD.

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
Then what?

Let's try to create FDA.
We have EADCF.

Let's look at the end string. BCDEABCBD.
If we have FDA -> CD.

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)
Then what?

EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF: EADCEA -> ADCBF

EADCF

EADCF -> EADCEA (1)

EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
2. EA -> BF EADCEA -> ADCBF

Let me ask for help.
