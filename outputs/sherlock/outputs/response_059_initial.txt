Okay, let's analyze the problem. The goal is to transform "FCFFD" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "FF"->"CCECD"
2) "EC"->"FF"
3) "CFFD"->"DD"
4) "CD"->"DB"
5) "FDBBDD"->""

Initial string: "FCFFD"

Let's try to apply the rules systematically.
FCFFD

1. **FCFFD -> FCCECD** using rule 1.
2. **FCCECD -> FCCECD** Rule 1 can't be applied again at the start.
3. Now let's observe the string for the presence of EC to use rule 2.
4. **FCCECD** contains EC which can be converted to FF.

Let's restart.

FCFFD
1. **FCFFD -> FCCECD** using rule 1.
2. **FCCECD** contains "EC" so using rule 2 we get "FCFFFCD".
This doesn't seem like a good approach.

Let's try to apply rule 3: "CFFD"->"DD"
The initial string "FCFFD" contains "CFFD" starting at position 2.
1. **FCFFD -> FDD** using rule 3
We need to transform FDD into FDBBDD to use rule 5.
2. We dont have a rule that can turn DD into DBBDD

Let's try another approach. We need to get to "FDBBDD" somehow.
Let's look at the transitions in reverse to see what could lead to the final state.
"FDBBDD" <- ""

We need to create 'FDBBDD'.
Let's see if any of the rules create parts of this string.

Rule 4: "CD"->"DB". This creates DB, which is part of FDBBDD.
Rule 5: "FDBBDD"->""
Rule 3: "CFFD"->"DD"
Rule 2: "EC"->"FF"
Rule 1: "FF"->"CCECD"

Starting string: "FCFFD"

1. FCFFD -> F(CCECD)D  [1]
2. FCCECDD
3. We need to create FDBBDD.
4. FCCECDD -> F(EC)CECDD doesnt help
5. FCCECDD -> F(FF)CECDD using rule 2, to reverse the first application.

Let's try to get 'CD' to use rule 4.

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FCCECD [1]
2. FCCECD. We need a CD.
3. Let's try something else.

We need "FDBBDD". We can make "DB" with "CD".
Let's focus on making "CD".

FCFFD
1. FCFFD -> FDD [3]
Now we have FDD. We want FDBBDD.
This isnt going anywhere.

JW HELP!
