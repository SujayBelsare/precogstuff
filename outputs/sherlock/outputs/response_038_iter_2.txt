John Watson provided the following feedback:
The key insight is to focus on creating the substring "BCDEABCBD" from "EADCF". Analyze how each transition can modify the string to get closer to this substring. Look for intermediate steps that might not be immediately obvious but bring you closer to the goal.

Okay, let's try to create "BCDEABCBD" from "EADCF".

EADCF

2) "CEA"->"AFBCBD"
3) "EA"->"BF"
4) "FDA"->"CD"
5) "BCDEABCBD"->""

EADCF -> BCDEABCBD

EADCF
1. F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA
We need to insert 'BCD' somewhere.
Let's see if we can create FDA.
EADCF. We can apply F -> EA. EADCF -> EADCEA.

The target is BCDEABCBD.
Let's work backward again from BCDEABCBD.

BCDEABCBD.
We want to get to EADCF.

Let's analyze rule 2: CEA -> AFBCBD. This rule seems important because it creates a large substring AFBCBD.
Let's try to create CEA.

To create CEA, we need C.
Let's look at rule 4: FDA -> CD. We need FDA.

FDA -> CD.

Let's try to create FDA.
EADCF.
F -> EA: EADCF -> EADCEA.

Let's try a different strategy.
Let's consider the end. We need BCDEABCBD.
The only way to get rid of this is rule 5.
So we need to create this.

EADCF -> BCDEABCBD.
Let's analyze the differences.

EADCF.
We need to insert BCD, E, AB, B.
F -> EA. EADCF -> EADCEA.
Now we have EA.

Let's try FDA -> CD. We don't have FDA.

Let's try to create FDA.
EADCF -> EADCEA (1).
