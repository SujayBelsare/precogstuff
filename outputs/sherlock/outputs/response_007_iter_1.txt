Okay, John Watson's hint is very helpful. Instead of trying to reduce "AFCAE" to "", let's see if we can generate "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" starting from the empty string "" using rule 1, then apply rule 2 to reduce it to "". The problem states that the transitions are applicable in one direction only, which means we cannot reverse them. But, we CAN create a string using transition 1 and then eliminate it using transition 2.
The target string for elimination is "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
Rule 1 adds "BC" to the string.
To make "BCBCBCBCAFCAE", we would need to apply rule 1 repeatedly.

Let's consider the target string "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". It contains "AFCAE".
We want to generate "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" from "". First apply rule 1: "" -> "BC".
We need to apply rule 1 multiple times to eventually form "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
If we apply rule 1 seven times, we get "BCBCBCBCBCBCBC".
This is not what we want.

However, the problem states that it is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable.
Let's try to find a path from "" to "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" using only rule 1, and then apply rule 2.

1. Apply rule 1: "" -> "BC".
2. We need to get "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
Since we can only add "BC" to the end of the string, there's no way to insert "AFCAE" into the string.

Let's rethink the problem. We are given "AFCAE" and want to get to "".
We have two rules:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

The problem is that rule 1 can only add "BC", so we have no way to modify "AFCAE".
The only way to get to "" is to transform "AFCAE" into "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". But we can't.

Let's analyze the transitions again:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""
Initial string: "AFCAE"

I'm stuck. I cannot find a way to transform the initial string "AFCAE" into the target string "".
The only applicable transition is rule 2, but it requires the string to be "BCBCBCBCAFCAE", which we cannot create from "AFCAE" using rule 1.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the empty string as a possible intermediate state. Can you go from AFCAE -> "" -> BCBCBCBCAFCAE -> "" ?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
