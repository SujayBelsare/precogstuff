Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. The initial string is "74865EC56AF" and we want to reduce it to "".

Available transitions:
1) ""->"EC"
2) "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"->""

Looking at the transitions, it seems like transition 3) is key to reaching the empty string, but it's a very specific and long string. We need to create this string from the initial string. The initial string "74865EC56AF" contains "C56AF", which can be transformed using rule 2. Let's see what happens if we apply rule 2:

"74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E"

Now we have "74865E2044CF7E". This looks like the end of the long string in rule 3. We are missing "ECECECECEC". Let's see if we can create the missing part.

We can't directly create the "ECECECECEC" part from "74865E2044CF7E".

It seems like we're stuck. Let's try to think backwards from the target string in rule 3: "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". We already have "74865EC56AF", so if we apply rule 2 we get "74865E2044CF7E". We want to get to "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". This means we need to insert "ECECECECEC" before "74865E2044CF7E". However, transition 1 creates "EC" from "", which doesn't seem useful here.

Let's try to think differently. We have "74865EC56AF". We want to get rid of it completely. Rule 3 requires "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".
We can apply rule 2 to the initial string, which gives us "74865E2044CF7E". We need to somehow generate "ECECECECEC" before that.
If we could apply rule 1 enough times, we could generate lots of "EC" substrings, but we have no way to insert them in the beginning of the string.

I think I'm stuck.
