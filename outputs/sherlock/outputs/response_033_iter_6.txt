Okay, John Watson is emphasizing starting with applicable rules from the initial state.

Initial string: BBBCAFBDEC

Rules:
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Rule 1 applies directly.

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFFBCA (1)

Now we have BBBFFBCA.

Let's analyze the rules again:

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Rule 2 is now applicable.

2. BBBFFBCA -> BFEBDCA (2)

Now we have BFEBDCA.

Let's analyze the rules again:

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Rule 3 is now applicable.

3. BFEBDCA -> BFFFE (3)

Now we have BFFFE.

Let's analyze the rules again:

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Rule 4 is now applicable.

4. BFFFE -> BFBBC (4)

Now we have BFBBC.

Let's analyze the rules again:

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Rule 5 is now applicable.

5. BFBBC -> "" (5)

So the final answer is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
