Okay, let's analyze the transitions and the target string for rule 7, which is "C0657116"->"". We need to get to this state.

Initial string: "54B9E8"

1. Apply rule 1: "E8"->"CD"
"54B9E8" -> "54B9CD"

2. Apply rule 2: "CD"->"6D7C"
"54B9CD" -> "54B96D7C"

3. Apply rule 3: "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
"54B96D7C" -> "54B2C1DC6"

4. Apply rule 4: "DC"->"E1"
"54B2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1E16"

Now, instead of rule 5, let's try applying rule 4 again to the 'E1'.  We can't.
Let's go back to rule 3. Maybe rule 3 is not correct. Let's try to avoid using rule 3 and see if we can get something else.
Let's see what JW is hinting at. We want "C0657116". We have "54B9E8".

1. "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"

Now, we need to somehow get "C0657116". Let's analyze the differences.
We have "54B96D7C".
We want "C0657116".

Let's try a different approach.
Starting with the end goal "C0657116", let's try to reverse engineer the transitions.

"C0657116" <- "547FEF7116" (rule 6 reversed)
"547FEF7116" <- "54B2C1E7116" (rule 5 reversed) This is not possible since rule 5 replaces B2C1E.

Let's try the initial steps again.
"54B9E8"
1. "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"

Now, let's think about the target "C0657116". We have a "71" in both strings, so let's keep that in mind.
Let's apply rule 3: "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
"54B96D7C" -> "54B2C1DC6"
Now, we need "C0657116". We have "54B2C1DC6". It seems very different.

Let's try another approach. We need "C0657116". Let's work backwards.
"C0657116" <- "547FEF7116" (rule 6 reversed)
"547FEF7116" <- "54B2C1E7116" (rule 5 reversed but not possible)

Let's apply rule 1,2 and 3 again.
"54B9E8" -> "54B9CD" -> "54B96D7C" -> "54B2C1DC6"
Now what?
Rule 4: "DC"->"E1"
"54B2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1E16"
Rule 5: "B2C1E"->"7FEF71"
"54B2C1E16" -> "547FEF716"
Rule 6: "547FEF"->"C065"
"547FEF716" -> "C065716"
We are close! We need a '1' at the end.

Let's think outside the box. Maybe we need to create another "DC" somewhere. Let's go back to "54B96D7C".
If we can change the '9' to a '6', we can apply rule 3 again.

Let's try a completely different approach.

Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, the hint suggests applying a transition multiple times. Let's look at the rules again.
1) "E8"->"CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C"
3) "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
4) "DC"->"E1"
5) "B2C1E"->"7FEF71"
6) "547FEF"->"C065"
7) "C0657116"->""

"54B9E8"

1. "E8"->"CD"  -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"
3. "96D7C"->"2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1DC6"
4. "DC"->"E1" -> "54B2C1E16"
5. "B2C1E"->"7FEF71" -> "547FEF16"
6. "547FEF"->"C065" -> "C06516"

Now we want "C0657116".
We have "C06516".
This is very far off.

Let's go back to step 4. Instead of applying rule 5, can we do something else?
We have "54B2C1E16". We want to create another "DC".

Let's analyze what happens if we apply rule 4 multiple times in a different scenario.

"54B9E8"
1. "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"

Now, the key is to get "C0657116".  We have "54B96D7C".
If we apply rule 3: "96D7C"->"2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1DC6".
Then rule 4: "DC"->"E1" -> "54B2C1E16"
Then rule 5: "B2C1E"->"7FEF71" -> "547FEF16"
Then rule 6: "547FEF"->"C065" -> "C06516"

The target is "C0657116".

Let's try another approach.  We need to find a way to get "7116" from "54B9E8". This seems impossible.

Let's try focusing on getting "C065".
"54B9E8"
1. "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"

We need "C065". Rule 6 can give us that if we have "547FEF".
Rule 5 can give us "7FEF71" if we have "B2C1E".

Let's go back.
"54B9E8"
1. "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2. "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"
3. "96D7C"->"2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1DC6"
4. "DC"->"E1" -> "54B2C1E16"

Now we have "54B2C1E16". We need "B2C1E" to apply rule 5. We have it!
5. "B2C1E"->"7FEF71" -> "547FEF16"
6. "547FEF"->"C065" -> "C06516"

We need to find a way to introduce "71" after "C065".

Let's think step by step.
"54B9E8"
1. E8 -> CD : "54B9CD"
2. CD -> 6D7C : "54B96D7C"
3. 96D7C -> 2C1DC6 : "54B2C1DC6"
4. DC -> E1: "54B2C1E16"
5. B2C1E -> 7FEF71: "547FEF716"
6. 547FEF -> C065: "C065716"

We have "C065716". We need a '1' at the end.

I'm still stuck.

Okay, let's focus on repeating substrings. We need "C0657116".
Let's look at the transitions again.
1) "E8"->"CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C"
3) "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
4) "DC"->"E1"
5) "B2C1E"->"7FEF71"
6) "547FEF"->"C065"
7) "C0657116"->""

"54B9E8"

1. E8 -> CD : "54B9CD"
2. CD -> 6D7C : "54B96D7C"
3. 96D7C -> 2C1DC6 : "54B2C1DC6"
4. DC -> E1: "54B2C1E16"
5. B2C1E -> 7FEF71: "547FEF716"
6. 547FEF -> C065: "C065716"

We have "C065716". We need a '1' at the end to get "C0657116".
Let's go back to "54B2C1DC6".

If we can somehow get another "DC" next to "DC6", we can apply rule 4 twice.

Let's think about what transitions create a '1'. Rule 4 does "DC"->"E1".
Rule 5 creates "7FEF71".

The main problem is the '9' in "54B9E8".

Let's try to work backwards from "C0657116".
"C0657116"
<- 6: "547FEF7116"
<- 5: "54B2C1E7116" - This is not possible.

Let's go back to basics.
"54B9E8"
1. "E8" -> "CD" : "54B9CD"
2. "CD" -> "6D7C" : "54B96D7C"
3. "96D7C" -> "2C1DC6" : "54B2C1DC6"

Now, we have "54B2C1DC6". We want "C0657116".

We need to find a way to generate "C0657116".
If we apply rule 4: "DC" -> "E1", we get "54B2C1E16".
Then we apply rule 5: "B2C1E" -> "7FEF71", we get "547FEF716".
Then we apply rule 6: "547FEF" -> "C065", we get "C065716".
Still missing a "1".

Let's try something different. Let's try to make "6D7C" appear again.
"54B9E8" -> "54B9CD" -> "54B96D7C". Now what? If we had a '9' before "6D7C", we could use rule 3 again.

Let's go back to "54B2C1DC6". We need to get "C0657116".

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
"54B9E8"
1. E8 -> CD : "54B9CD"
2. CD -> 6D7C : "54B96D7C"
3. 96D7C -> 2C1DC6 : "54B2C1DC6"
4. DC -> E1: "54B2C1E16"
5. B2C1E -> 7FEF71: "547FEF7116"
6. 547FEF -> C065: "C0657116"
7. C0657116 -> ""
