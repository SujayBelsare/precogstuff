Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "CCBDAF", and the goal is to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "CB"->"FD"
2) "DAF"->"AB"
3) "C"->"FF"
4) "AB"->"BE"
5) "F"->"AB"
6) "ABFFDBE"->""

Let's start by applying the transitions and see where it leads.
CCBDAF
Applying rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Applying rule 3 to the first C: FFFBDAF

This doesn't seem to be a good path. Let's try something else. We want to get "ABFFDBE" at some point.
CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF

Maybe we can try getting CB first, since it becomes FD.
CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

This doesn't seem right. Let's try another approach.
CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the first F: ABFFBDAF

We are closer to ABFFDBE.
ABFFBDAF

Let's try to reason backwards.
We need ABFFDBE.
Before that, we need to create the substring "AB".
We can create AB by applying rule 2 to DAF. Also, rule 5 changes F to AB.
We have CCBDAF.
Let's apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the first F: ABFFBDAF
We need to get D in the correct position.

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 5 to F: ABCBDAF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the first F: ABFFBDAF
We need to change BDAF to FFDBE.

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to first F: ABFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to second F: ABABABDAF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the first F: ABCBDAF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to both Cs: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to first F: ABFFBDAF

Let's try to get DAF first.
CCBDAF

Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF. Now we have FFCBDAF
Apply rule 5 to F: ABCBDAF. now we have ABCBDAF
Apply rule 4 to AB: BECBDAF. Now we have BECBDAF

Let's apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF.
Then apply rule 5 to the first F: ABFFBDAF.

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to the first C: FFCBDAF
Apply rule 1 to CB: FFDAFDF

CCBDAF
Apply rule 3 to both C's: FFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the first F: ABFFBDAF
Apply rule 5 to the second F: ABABABDAF
