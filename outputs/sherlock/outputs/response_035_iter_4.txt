Okay, let's rethink this to minimize applications of rule 2. We need "EFEFEFEFDFFA". That's four "EF"s, then "DFFA".

Starting with "DBFFA":
1. Rule 2: "EFDBFFA"
Now we have one "EF". We need three more.
2. Rule 2: "EFEFDBFFA"
Now we have two "EF"s.
3. Rule 2: "EFEFEFDBFFA"
Now we have three "EF"s.
4. Rule 2: "EFEFEFEFDBFFA"
Now we have four "EF"s. So we have "EFEFEFEFDBFFA".

We want "EFEFEFEFDFFA". So we need to change "DBFFA" to "DFFA".
5. Rule 1: "EFEFEFEFDFFA"

Now we have "EFEFEFEFDFFA".
6. Rule 3: ""

So the sequence is [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3].

It seems we can't reduce the number of applications of Rule 2. We need 4 of them to get the "EFEFEFEF" part. Then we use rule 1 to remove the B, then rule 3 to finish.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]}$
