Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "EDFDDBECF" and we want to reduce it to "". The available transitions are:

1) "CF"->"DF"
2) "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
3) ""->"CB"
4) "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""

Let's try applying rule 1:
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Applying rule 2 on the original string:
EDFDDBECF -> does not contain EDFDDBE, so it cannot be used.

Let's try to apply rule 1 to the initial string:
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Now, can we use rule 2? No.
Can we use rule 3? No, because we want to reduce to empty string.

We can use rule 1 repeatedly.
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Let's try to transform "EDFDDBECF" into "CBCBEBAEEDF" somehow.
We can use rule 1 to get "EDFDDBEDF". This doesn't seem to help.

Let's think backward.
We want to get "CBCBEBAEEDF".
Rule 4: "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""
So we must get "CBCBEBAEEDF".

We have "EDFDDBECF".

Let's try to use rule 1 repeatedly.
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Rule 2: "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
So, if we had "EDFDDBECF", we could make it into "EBAEECF".

Let's use rule 1 on the initial string.
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

Now, let's try to think step by step. We want to get rid of EDFDDBE, and we can transform it into EBAEE.
So, EDFDDBECF -> EBAEECF, using rule 2 is not possible directly.
Let's apply rule 1.
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF.

What if we use rule 1 first?
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF. Now, we have EDFDDBE.

How about applying rule 1 twice?
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF.
Then, we can't use rule 2.

Let's analyze the target "CBCBEBAEEDF".
We have "EDFDDBECF".

Let's apply rule 1:
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

We need to create CBCBEBAEEDF. The last two characters are DF.
Let's apply rule 1 to the original string:
EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

JW HELP!
