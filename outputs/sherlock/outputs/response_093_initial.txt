Okay, let's analyze the initial string "A568648" and the available transitions to find a path to an empty string.

Initial string: "A568648"

Available transitions:
1) "48"->"F7"
2) "A56"->"84D"
3) "84D"->"E7"
4) "E786F"->"F8F4783"
5) "8F4783"->"B0E2"
6) "F"->"F2"
7) "F2B0E27"->""

First, let's see what transitions can be applied directly to "A568648". We can apply transition 2, "A56"->"84D".

A568648 -> 84D8648  [2]

Now we have "84D8648". We can apply transition 3, "84D"->"E7".

84D8648 -> E78648 [3]

Now we have "E78648". We can apply transition 1, "48"->"F7".

E78648 -> E786F7 [1]

Now we have "E786F7". We can apply transition 6, "F"->"F2".

E786F7 -> E786F27 [6]

Now we have "E786F27". We need to find a way to use rule 7, "F2B0E27"->"". Let's look back at "E786F27". We need to find a way to get "B0E2" into this string. Notice that we have "E7" at the beginning of our current string. Looking at rule 4, we have "E786F"->"F8F4783". Let's try to make the substring "E786F" from our current string.

Looking at "E786F27" we can see that we have to go backwards to fix the approach. We need to create an "E786F" substring, then apply rule 4, and then apply rule 5, etc.

Let's start again from "A568648".

A568648 -> 84D8648  [2]
84D8648 -> E78648 [3]
E78648 -> E786F7 [1]
E786F7 -> E786F27 [6]

The goal is to get "F2B0E27". We need to apply rule 4 at some point: "E786F"->"F8F4783".
Let's try inserting an "F" earlier.

A568648 -> 84D8648 [2]
Let's apply rule 1 to "48" in "8648".
84D8648 -> 84D86F7 [1]
84D86F7 -> E786F7 [3]
E786F7 -> E786F27 [6]

We are stuck again.
