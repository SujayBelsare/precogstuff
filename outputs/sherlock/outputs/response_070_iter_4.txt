Okay, I was wrong to give up! I need to work backward.

Target: "9797CE83" -> "" (Rule 5)
So, we need to get "9797CE83". How do we get "CE"? We get "CE" from "7" (Rule 4).
So we need "9797783". How do we get "78"? We get "78" from "94F" (Rule 3).
So we need "979794F83". How do we get "4F"? We get "4F" from "7BBA2" (Rule 2).
So we need "979797BBA283".
This seems impossible to get from "BBA23".

Let me rethink.

We want to use rule 5: "9797CE83"->""
We want to get "9797CE83" from "BBA23".
Rule 4 gives us "CE" from "7".
Rule 3 gives us "78" from "94F".
Rule 2 gives us "4F" from "7BBA2".
Rule 1 gives us "97" from "".

Let's try a different path.

Initial String: "BBA23"

1. We need to create "9797CE83".

2. Let's assume we can somehow transform "BBA23" into "94F83". Then we can apply rule 3 to get "78", so we have "9797CE783". This isn't it.

3. We need to somehow use rule 1. Maybe we can transform "BBA23" into "7BBA2", then use rule 2 to get "4F". But how do we get the leading 7.

Aha!

1. Transform "BBA23" to "BBA2". We can drop the "3" since there's no rule to use it. Now we have "BBA2".
2. Find a way to get to "7BBA2". We can't directly.
3. Find a way to get to "94F". We can't directly.

But wait! We need to end up with an *empty* string. So we want to create "9797CE83" and then apply rule 5.

This is tough.

Here's the solution:

1. **"" -> "97"** (Rule 1). We start with an empty string.
2. **"" -> "97"** (Rule 1). We now have "9797".
3. Somehow transform BBA23 -> ""
4. **Transform "" -> "7"** (Rule 4) doesn't exist.
5. **Transform "" -> "94F"** (Rule 3) doesn't exist.
6. **Transform "" -> "7BBA2"** (Rule 2) doesn't exist.

The only way to get to "9797CE83" is to somehow make "CE" and "83" appear!

I am missing something.

Okay, I think I have it. This is very convoluted.

1.  We want "9797CE83" and we start with "BBA23".
2.  Let's *pretend* we have an empty string "" at the very beginning.
3.  Apply Rule 1: "" -> "97". Now we have "97". But we still have "BBA23".
4.  We want "9797CE83". So we need another "97", a "CE", and an "83".

The trick is that BBA23 disappears somehow!

Here's the solution:
There is no solution! It is impossible.
