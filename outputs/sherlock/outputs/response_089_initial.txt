Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "9E3368D" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "33"->"DA"
2) "8"->"25"
3) "A62"->"59C7"
4) "ED5"->"E7"
5) "E79"->"3D"
6) "DC7"->"1B"
7) "931B5D"->""

Let's try applying the rules step-by-step.

"9E3368D"
1. Apply rule 1: "33"->"DA"
"9EDA68D"
2. Apply rule 2: "8"->"25"
"9EDA625D"
Now we want to get to the rule 7 "931B5D". Let's try to form that expression.
3. Apply rule 3: "A62"->"59C7"
"9ED59C75D"
4. Apply rule 4: "ED5"->"E7"
"9E79C75D"
5. Apply rule 5: "E79"->"3D"
"93DC75D"
6. Apply rule 6: "DC7"->"1B"
"931B5D"
7. Apply rule 7: "931B5D"->""
""

Solution: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Reasoning:
1. We start with "9E3368D".
2. Apply rule 1 ("33"->"DA") to get "9EDA68D".
3. Apply rule 2 ("8"->"25") to get "9EDA625D".
4. Apply rule 3 ("A62"->"59C7") to get "9ED59C75D".
5. Apply rule 4 ("ED5"->"E7") to get "9E79C75D".
6. Apply rule 5 ("E79"->"3D") to get "93DC75D".
7. Apply rule 6 ("DC7"->"1B") to get "931B5D".
8. Apply rule 7 ("931B5D"-> "") to get "".

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
