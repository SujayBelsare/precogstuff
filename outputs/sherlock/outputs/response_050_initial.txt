Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "CFBEE", and we want to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "CFBEE"->"BDEB"
2) "BDEB"->"BA"
3) "A"->"ADFCC"
4) "FCC"->"DEF"
5) "BADFCCDDEF"->""

Let's start by applying the first transition:
CFBEE -> BDEB
[1]

Now the string is "BDEB". We can apply the second transition:
BDEB -> BA
[1, 2]

Now the string is "BA". We need to get to "BADFCCDDEF" somehow.
Let's apply the third transition to A:
A -> ADFCC
So, BA -> BADFCC
[1, 2, 3]

Now the string is "BADFCC". We need "DDEF" at the end to match transition 5.
Let's apply transition 4 to "FCC":
FCC -> DEF
So, BADFCC -> BADDEF
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Now the string is "BADDEF". We are close to the final transition. We need "FCCDDEF" instead of "DEF".
Let's try to go back and see if there is a better path from "BA".

From BA, apply transition 3: BA -> BADFCC
From BADFCC, apply transition 4: BADFCC -> BADDEF. This doesn't seem to work.

Let's try applying transition 3 again: A -> ADFCC
BA -> BADFCC
[1, 2, 3]
Now string is BADFCC
Apply transition 4 to FCC:
BADFCC -> BADDEF
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Now string is BADDEF.
This doesn't work.

Let's go back. We have "BA".
We need "BADFCCDDEF". Can we insert "DFCCDDE" somewhere?
Let's analyze backwards. We need "BADFCCDDEF" -> "". Before this we need to get "BADFCCDDEF"
We currently have "CFBEE".

CFBEE -> BDEB [1]
BDEB -> BA [2]
BA -> BADFCC [3]
BADFCC -> BADDEF [4]
BADDEF -> does not lead to BADFCCDDEF

Let's try another path.
Instead of using transition 2, let's see if we can get "A" from "BDEB". There doesn't seem to be a way.
Maybe we need to apply transition 3 first.
But A is nowhere to be found.

CFBEE -> BDEB [1]
Now we have BDEB. We need to somehow get ADFCCDDEF.
Let's think. Is there a way to get an "A" ?
No.
