Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "A728DB0EA3550" and the goal is to reduce it to "". The available transitions are:

1) "3550"->"883"
2) "B0EA"->"1E"
3) "8D"->"C8"
4) "883"->"64"
5) "E6"->"C83"
6) ""->"4BD"
7) "4BDA72C81C834"->""

Let's try applying the transitions and see where it leads.

A728DB0EA3550

First, apply rule 1:
A728DB0EA883

Next, apply rule 4:
A728DB0EA64

We want to reach "4BDA72C81C834". We have "A728DB0EA64". It doesn't seem like we can directly get there. Let's try to manipulate the initial string in a different way.

A728DB0EA3550

Apply rule 2:
A728D1E3550

Apply rule 1:
A728D1E883

Apply rule 4:
A728D1E64

This doesn't seem to bring us closer. Let's try again from the start.

A728DB0EA3550

Apply rule 1:
A728DB0EA883

Apply rule 4:
A728DB0EA64

We have "A728DB0EA64". We need to get "4BDA72C81C834".
Let's try applying rule 2 first:
A728DB0EA3550 -> A728D1E3550

Now apply rule 1:
A728D1E3550 -> A728D1E883

Now apply rule 4:
A728D1E883 -> A728D1E64

This doesn't work.

I'm stuck. Let's call John Watson for help.
