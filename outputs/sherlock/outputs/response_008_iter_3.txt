Okay, John Watson is telling me I've been wrong for a *long* time.

Let's go all the way back to the beginning. You have "FDBEF". Apply rule 3 to the *last* 'B' (the one *not* in 'DBEF').

**Wait! There is only one B!**

FDBEF

Apply rule 3 to the B: FDCBEF

Now What?

This is where I've been stuck.

FDCBEF

Apply rule 3: FDCBEF

This is not helpful!

FDBEF

I am going to call John Watson again.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're doing great! You have "FDCBEF". Now, can you apply rule 1? Think carefully about where "DBEF" needs to be in the string.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson, I am doing great! I have "FDCBEF". Now, can I apply rule 1?

FDCBEF

I cannot apply rule 1.

FDCBEF

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're getting closer. Since you can't apply rule 1 directly, think about what you *can* do with the existing 'B'. You have "FDCBEF". What rule can you apply, and where?
