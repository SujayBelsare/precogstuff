John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're getting closer! Focus on the order of operations. You need to create "ABABCFFF" and then use transition 5. Think about how each transformation affects the string and whether it helps you get closer to the target. Avoid premature application of the ED -> FF rule.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
ECBEFABAED

1. ECBEF -> EBEB
2. ED -> FF
3. ABA -> CF
4. EB -> AB
5. ABABCFFF -> ""

ECBEFABAED -> EBEBABAED [1]
Now EB -> AB twice:
EBEBABAED -> ABABABAED [4, 4]
Now ABA -> CF:
ABABABAED -> ABABCFED [3]
Now ED -> FF:
ABABCFED -> ABABCFFF [2]
Now use transition 5:
ABABCFFF -> "" [5]

So the sequence is [1, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5]

```
ECBEFABAED
EBEBABAED [1]
ABABABAED [4, 4]
ABABCFED [3]
ABABCFFF [2]
"" [5]
```

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5]}$
