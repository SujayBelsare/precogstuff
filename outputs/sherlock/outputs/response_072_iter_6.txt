Okay, let's focus on the rules that replace specific parts of the string.

A728DB0EA3550

1) "3550"->"883"
2) "B0EA"->"1E"
3) "8D"->"C8"
4) "883"->"64"
5) "E6"->"C83"
6) ""->"4BD"
7) "4BDA72C81C834"->""

The goal is to make "4BDA72C81C834".

We need to make 4BDA from something. The only possible source seems to be 8D, B0EA, and 3550.

Let's consider substitutions near the beginning of the string.
The beginning of the string is A728D.

We need to get 4BDA there.

A728DB0EA3550
1. Rule 3: A72C8B0EA3550 (8D -> C8). Now we have A72C8. The target is 4BDA72C8.
2. Rule 2: A72C81E3550 (B0EA -> 1E)

We want to make "4BDA72".

Let's work backward.
We need to make 4BDA *before* A72.
This means the "8D" in "A728D" needs to transform into "4BDA72". This is impossible, and I am going crazy.

A728DB0EA3550
The "DB0EA" can only become "D1E".

Let's try another approach.

To get to "4BDA72C81C834" we need to apply rule 7.
So we need to transform A728DB0EA3550 -> 4BDA72C81C834

A728DB0EA3550

1. Rule 2: A728D1E3550.
2. Rule 1: A728D1E883.

I am completely lost.
