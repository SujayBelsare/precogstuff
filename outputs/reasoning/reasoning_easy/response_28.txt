Okay, let's analyze this carefully. We want to transform "BCEEF" into an empty string using the provided transitions:

1.  "CEEF"->"AC"
2.  ""->"CD"  (This can only be used if the string is empty "")
3.  "CDCDCDBAC"->""

Initial string: "BCEEF"

Here's the reasoning:

1. We start with "BCEEF".  The first applicable rule is transition 1: "CEEF"->"AC".
   Applying this transforms "BCEEF" to "BAC".

2. The string is now "BAC". The critical observation is that we need to introduce "CD" to get the entire target "CDCDCDBAC". Rule 2 allows us to add "CD" to an empty string, but we don't yet have an empty string. This is a dead end.
However, this approach is clearly going down the wrong track.
3. Going Back to 'BCEEF', let's first consider how to get from 'BAC', and think backward
4. Back to 'BAC' Let's suppose if somehow we can obtain CDCDCDBAC,
How would we do so?
"CDCDCDBAC" is a 9 letter string so we need to ADD. Let's think further how we can manipulate initial 'BCEEF' via subtraction only. If there is no path by reducing to "" we should start consider if 'CDCDCDBAC' would occur at any point via addition and reducing from there!

Another approach is to consider what is preventing us to have string being reduced into empty.

Let's consider string, "BCEEF" applying only transition one.
"BCEEF" -> "BAC". We need 'CDCDCDBAC'. Let us work backwards.
We need BAC within CDCDCDBAC. We note that CDCDCD'BAC', thus before applying transistion three, we must make BCEEF to CDCDCD'BAC'. Since we know only reducing is NOT an option. Let's rethink a solution which leads to ''.
BCEEF might have something todo with "" to CD transistion.

After reviewing many possible options, I concluded something which I did not follow, transistion are applicable on one transition only which is the *first* occurence in this problem only and will be fixed!

BCEEF must use 1 as its starting transistion!
1) "CEEF"->"AC"

"BCEEF" => "BAC"
Since other transistions does not contain C, E, B other transistions is practically impossible at present! With transistion "CDCDCDBAC"->"", we should not assume the BAC in front matters.

Consider transition:
3) "CDCDCDBAC"->""

Since this does not apply lets rethink:
If transistion two (""->"CD") is only possible when the inital string, the problem becomes unsovleable and so "" cannot exist when inital string isn't '' which make transition 2 to be *impossible*!!

Lets consider 'AC' exists with BCEEF once its reduced 'BAC', BAC is only a 3 letter string while other transistion does not contains it

THEREFORE:
After many backtracking attempts.
The problem is actually unsolvable since rule two and rule 3 never will apply at anytime! This may indicate a challenge to verify whether the game problems are always solvable or NOT but i digress!

Therefore the solution would be impossible!
Impossible
