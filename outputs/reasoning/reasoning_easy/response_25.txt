Okay, let's analyze this Sed Puzzle Game problem and determine the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial String: "FFADA"
Available Transitions:
1) "A"->"AF"
2) "FFAFFFFDA"->""

Goal: Empty String ""

The challenge here lies in transforming "FFADA" into "FFAFFFFDA" to apply the second rule. This will require multiple applications of rule 1 to introduce enough "F"s.

Step 1: Apply rule 1 to transform "A" into "AF": FFADA -> FFAFDA
Transition List: [1]

Step 2: Apply rule 1 to transform "A" into "AF": FFAFDA -> FFAFFDA
Transition List: [1, 1]

Step 3: Apply rule 1 to transform "A" into "AF": FFAFFDA -> FFAFFFDA
Transition List: [1, 1, 1]

Step 4: Apply rule 1 to transform "A" into "AF": FFAFFFDA -> FFAFFFFDA
Transition List: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Now, the string is "FFAFFFFDA", which matches the pattern in rule 2.

Step 5: Apply rule 2 to transform "FFAFFFFDA" into "": FFAFFFFDA -> ""
Transition List: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]

Final Answer:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
