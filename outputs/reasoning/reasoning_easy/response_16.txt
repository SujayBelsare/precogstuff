Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "BCECE" and we have the following transitions:

1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

We want to reach an empty string. Let's try to apply the transformations strategically.

First, apply transformation 1: "ECE"->"EA" to "BCECE" resulting in "BCEA".
Next, apply transformation 2: ""->"BB" . This is interesting, since it would add to our expression. Don't apply right now.
Since the only rule that empties the string is rule 3: "BBBBBBBCEA"->"" we are trying to generate this string
"BCECE"-> "BCEA" and the next step needs to give us 7 'B' characters
How do we add B's? using transition 2. We need a zero length substring which makes no sense. The transition "" -> "BB" means you can only append if the current string is empty. Let's rethink
Given that applying rule 1 once yields "BCEA", let's consider how we can get "BBBBBBBCEA" from "BCEA"
That means we would need to add 7 'B's. This can only be achieved if there is a transition to add B's.
Ah, this means we would need a step that removes a large chunk of "BCECE" for transformation 2 to make sense

Okay, I think I understand. We want to produce the string "BBBBBBBCEA".  We have "BCECE" initially.  Let's reduce what we have and hope that by applying rule 1 a couple of times, we could set the stage for final annihilation through Rule 3
Apply rule 1. "ECE"->"EA" to "BCECE" resulting in "BCEA"
Now, here's a critical realization. Applying rule 2, ""->"BB" only affects an empty string. We therefore are chasing Rule 3, which makes it hard for it to be an intermediate state, or else we will have no other rules left. This makes the problem unsolvable
There is an error, transition 2 should NOT exist.

Okay, the core of the issue is how to construct a sequence of transitions which allows to generate a BBBBBBBCEA string with "ECE"->"EA" which will yield BCEA
There are two ways in the beginning : rule 1 and rule 2 but let's focus our initial expression which gives us "BCEA"

We can only apply Rule 1: BCECE -> BCEA
After we reached BCEA, the only available transition is rule 3 if we can generate  "BBBBBBBCEA" out of our current string . Thus, our aim is to have an expression that looks something like :

->BBBBBBBCEA
->BCEA , we can cancel B and have a expression of :
"BBBBBB"

I am stuck, since i can't introduce 'B' given these transformations, lets think of a way to solve "BCECE" to nothing instead.
BCECE
Rule 1: ECE->EA, which yields "BCEA"
We want to go to empty
Thus: BCEA -> "" using available transformations and rule 3 only. However this transition won't work:
"BBBBBBBCEA"

There must be a trick somewhere. After BCEA, we could potentially reverse, however BCECE would give us some sort of an idea
The goal must be creating the final reduction expression via Rule 3 : "BBBBBBBCEA"->""
Starting expression is: BCECE

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1]}$
Reasoning:

1.  Apply Rule 1 "ECE"->"EA" to "BCECE" to get "BCEA" which does not allow an empty string via Rule 3 alone. After the given move, we end. There seems to be NO correct and viable answer for that matter as a result.

"BCECE"->"" is unsolvable.
There may be missing additional transition expression but for this problem given rules available that could make the expression work as described in the beginning of the statement. The expression only returns "BCEA" instead. Given available transitions we want the empty set "" as end result which the transformation provided is UNABLE to complete. If only single transition possible the first is only transition available!
