Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "3A0FD2EF" into "".

The available transitions are:
1) "0FD"->"89"
2) "EF"->"2B"
3) "A8922B"->"4F6AAE"
4) "3"->"337"
5) ""->"0C" (This can't be the very first transition because it adds to an existing nonempty string.)
6) "0C0C3374F6AAE"->""

Initial string: "3A0FD2EF"

Let's think step-by-step:

1. Apply transition 1 to "3A0FD2EF":  "3A0FD2EF" -> "3A892EF"
2. Apply transition 2 to "3A892EF": "3A892EF" -> "3A8922B"
3. Apply transition 3 to "3A8922B": "3A8922B" -> "34F6AAE"
4. Apply transition 4 to "34F6AAE": "34F6AAE" -> "3374F6AAE"
5. The current string now "3374F6AAE" is becoming similar to one of the substrings in the final rule.
However the final rule requires that the initial string also contain: 0C0C

Let's go back to the original and approach it differently, focusing on using transition 6 at the very end, thus forcing the entire string to transform to the required substring.
The substring is: "0C0C3374F6AAE"

Initial string: "3A0FD2EF"

1. Apply transition 1 to "3A0FD2EF": "3A0FD2EF" -> "3A892EF"
2. Apply transition 2 to "3A892EF": "3A892EF" -> "3A8922B"
3. Apply transition 3 to "3A8922B": "3A8922B" -> "34F6AAE"
4. Apply transition 4 to "34F6AAE": "34F6AAE" -> "3374F6AAE"

We have now produced: 3374F6AAE. We are so close to "0C0C3374F6AAE".
It looks like "0C0C" must come from using the empty string. We would never be able to complete this question otherwise.

1. Apply transition 1 to "3A0FD2EF": "3A0FD2EF" -> "3A892EF"
2. Apply transition 2 to "3A892EF": "3A892EF" -> "3A8922B"
3. Apply transition 3 to "3A8922B": "3A8922B" -> "34F6AAE"
4. Apply transition 4 to "34F6AAE": "34F6AAE" -> "3374F6AAE"
5. Apply transition 5 to "": producing "0C".  Since transition 5 occurs by itself we now concatenate them. "" becomes "0C"
6. Apply transition 5 again "" -> "0C", thus  "0C" becomes "0C0C"

Thus concatenate "0C0C" with "3374F6AAE", this equals "0C0C3374F6AAE". This means before step 5., "" is concatenated with the remaining substring "3374F6AAE", leading to the entire solution.
The complete string should now be "0C0C3374F6AAE".
Apply transition 6 "0C0C3374F6AAE"-> "".
Let us think this through again.

1. "3A0FD2EF" - Initial String
2. Apply 1: "3A892EF"
3. Apply 2: "3A8922B"
4. Apply 3: "34F6AAE"
5. Apply 4: "3374F6AAE"
6. Apply 5 (twice conceptually concatenated with string from step 5): producing "0C0C3374F6AAE" - Apply concatenations now rather than at the last step, where the entire function converts to "". Thus 5 only acts in tandem with 6
7. Apply 6: ""

[1, 2, 3, 4, 6] since 5 acted as concatenation. 5 and 6 must occur tandem.

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
