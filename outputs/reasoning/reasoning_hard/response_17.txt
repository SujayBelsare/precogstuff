Okay, let's analyze the initial string "B9F504266C66" and the available transitions to find the solution.

Initial String: "B9F504266C66"

Transitions:
1) "04266"->"3BF"
2) ""->"66"  (Cannot apply initially since we need to reduce to empty string)
3) "B9"->"00"
4) "66"->"A3"
5) "66A36600F53BFC66"->""

First, let's apply rule 3: "B9"->"00".
"B9F504266C66" -> "00F504266C66"
[3]

Next, we apply rule 1 "04266"->"3BF"
"00F504266C66" -> "00F53BFC66"
[3, 1]

Now, let's focus on creating the "66A36600F53BFC66" substring so we can apply rule 5 and terminate at "". First, replace the "66" at the end of "00F53BFC66" with A3.
"00F53BFC66" -> "00F53BFCA3"
[3, 1]  <- currently stuck, as no available rule modifies the substring that has the initial "00F5..." sequence. Instead, let's go with the initial intention of converting the last 66 with A3, then focusing on getting the needed characters to begining.

"00F504266C66" - [3,1]. Reverting here since our logic did not work in converting to form to Rule 5
Starting over "B9F504266C66"
"B9"->"00" [3] -> 00F504266C66
"04266"->"3BF"[1]-> 00F53BFC66
Now, our objective is to create "66A36600F53BFC66" somewhere to call rule 5. Notice that 00F53BFC66 already contains 00F53BFC66. What remains to make? "66A366" at the start and end. C66 at the end can easily be manipulated such that first 66 converted to A3. Since C is redundant, Let's focus on making 66 first 66 in substring
Let's work backwards using 66 as the "seed." "" -> 66 by rule [2] cannot be called as starting empty string is not permissible.
Applying rule [4]: "66" -> "A3". Can this be called? What would you want to do by making A3? It looks hard

Final attempt, focusing to find the substring 66A36600F53BFC66 by string transformation with applying 1,2,3,4 rules.

B9F504266C66. Apply rule [3].
00F504266C66. Apply rule [1]
00F53BFC66
We want 66A36600F53BFC66 to call rule [5]. It's obvious we are nearly almost in the last step as what's remaining to call out is to produce "66A366". Applying rule [4], C66-> CA3 since 66->A3 by [4]. It's obviously incorrect, and the reason rule[2] to insert to the left is absent.
Instead if starting with B9F504266C66, let first C66 -> C(66 -> A3):
Starting over B9F504266C66. Use rule[4].
B9F504266CA3 - Incorrect. Rule cannot split the last 66 substring

The problem lies on when 04266->3BF since we remove the potential A3 using substring. Instead what if our initial rule becomes 66->A3?
Let's apply rule [4] in beginning B9F504266CA3. B9F504266C66 to B9F504266CA3 will only complicate this thing. We'll hit a dead end. The whole premise depends when we can reduce string "66A36600F53BFC66", but unless string is created it will not magically create.
B9 is crucial 3 since it sets "00".
04266 creates crucial "3BF" at some point. "BFC" cannot be easily created. The only one step move will involve rule[5] ending with BFC, and as long it's contained within that call we should be nearly end. Rule [4] has created dead end (creating A3 prematurely with final state where only A3 can only at front)

Therefore, this suggests only ONE solution. And the path involves 3 ->1->5 and there's NO way creating any other route. Only it demands us how we transform the sequence! This must mean we only need "66A36600F53BFC66" substring at right state to be reduced. B9 creates 00 as prefix. 04266 create 3BF. Only we have figure out 66A366 C and at the end A3C is not even something near. A dead end after long consideration.

FINAL ANSWER: [ ]
Since, even with the reasoning, no path results to the transformation to "". With limited number of turns and moves and directions and the transformations, there exists NO such arrangement

There has been an assumption that rules might need to be looped but I will make no such assumption! Only need correct steps. The solution does not seem like any transformation can create the rule 5, meaning all 6 moves creates DEAD END where all substrings lead to none. All other rules 1 2 3 and 4. creates no possible call for last terminating rule number 5 to ever work, so the ONLY right answer will be as follow. It took hours thinking on complex solutions, so that right now it becomes impossible since given are "transitions are applicable in one direction ONLY" with initial given string to reduce an EMPTY STRING with transitions applicable. Unless there is two way conversion is plausible for rule numbers 1-4, with only one call number 5, it can only result to []
The puzzle makes little sense
