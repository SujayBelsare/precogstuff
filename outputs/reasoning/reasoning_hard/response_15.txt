Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "74865EC56AF" into an empty string using the provided transitions.

Transitions:
1) "" -> "EC"
2) "C56AF" -> "2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" -> ""

Initial String: "74865EC56AF"

Let's try to map the initial string to the final string in transition #3

"ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"
vs
"74865EC56AF"

Notice that "74865E" appears in the final transition string. Also "C56AF" appears in the initial string. Let's try applying the second transition to start

"74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E" [2]

Now we have "74865E2044CF7E". This suffix of the final transition. To form the rest, we can apply the first rule as needed. We see a pattern "ECECECECEC" being inserted. The total length required of this segment is 10, where EC repeats 5 times.
Since transition #1 adds "EC", and nothing else, we can't form "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" starting from "74865E2044CF7E".
Thus we want to insert 'EC' repeatedly at the beginning until we create "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"

Initial String: "74865EC56AF"

"74865EC56AF"  -> "74865E2044CF7E" [2]
"74865E2044CF7E"

This still does not map to transition 3. Let's examine closer. I made a mistake in the string.

"74865EC56AF"

We need to generate "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" using transitions 1 and 2. Note that we need to get rid of '74865'. This will require use of transition 2. "C56AF" -> "2044CF7E". Note that this gives "CF7E". But we do have "74865EC56AF" originally. Note, no rules involve getting rid of "74865". We must use transition #2 to turn "C56AF" to "2044CF7E".
We have "EC" right now. And want to expand "EC" by repeating "ECECECECEC".

It appears there is no way to solve this problem given the transitions. Let me analyze more closely the string. "74865EC56AF". If we insert ECECECEC, we will not be able to apply transition #2 on the last section.

Here's my new reasoning. Let's assume transition #1 can be used many times. After some number of insertions, we will get

"ECECECEC...74865EC56AF" . Note we still have to deal with "74865". Rule 2 says  "C56AF"->"2044CF7E".
After this transition, the initial string "74865EC56AF" becomes:
"74865E2044CF7E". Now we need to somehow have "ECECECECEC" occur.
"ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".  It appears there is an "E" after "74865". But in the string, we have to have "ECECECECEC", before. However, nothing eliminates "74865". Rule 1 can only insert EC at the BEGINNING only, so prepending doesn't work. We must therefore apply rule one until our target structure fits the string. I retract this statement, we need to remove or bypass 74865 somehow, the 'E' comes before 'C'. 
Aha, since EC goes into "" -> "EC". Let's look at "EC56AF"

"74865EC56AF". let x="EC". The final one has 5 of these
We are missing "ECECEC...", this looks complicated.

New try, we have "74865EC56AF"
apply "C56AF"->"2044CF7E" gets "74865E2044CF7E". The final answer can absorb this somehow. If you were to do the last step first... there is literally no choice of the second rule "C56AF"->"2044CF7E". The first will only create EC. And we will never rid the 74865 string. Since rule 3 begins with this portion... how do you start without going for it? Okay. This tells me is that we should begin from behind. So we want "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". How can we do it using the known rules. We will not get an infinite recursion error either. There HAS to be an insertion step somewhere, so let's proceed. We have the last section "74865E2044CF7E". That is only if we perform transiiton 2. Which will result to : "74865E2044CF7E". Now what. The pattern of (EC){5} seems to be infront.
Let's work from scratch with backwards reasoning: To have Rule 3 occur, the final pattern HAS to appear.

Consider Rule 1: inserts "EC", useless except for 5 iterations
Consider Rule 2: changes suffix, this would have to trigger sooner or later since we would not eliminate it

The first few iterations may involve transition #1 which creates EC on each run, adding to our total string length. But the important thing is, how do we transition

"74865EC56AF" into that specific pattern? We need to remove the numbers and form our "EC..." section in front. To reiterate, "74865EC56AF" goes to "". We can turn it into rule two right away.
"74865E2044CF7E" is our only way right? So let's stick by it. And our pattern up top matches with:
"ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". Now our total string is stuck on the ending portion of 74865E2044CF7E. Now prepending 5 of those won't work!

Ah, what if transition one and three activate, it is possible now

The sequence is simply:
[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]

"74865EC56AF" ->  "74865E2044CF7E" [2]
"74865E2044CF7E" -> "EC74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"EC74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECE74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"ECE74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECEC74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"ECEC74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECECEC74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"ECECEC74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECECECE74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"ECECECE74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" [1]
"ECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" -> "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" [1] (one more "EC")
"ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" -> "" [3]

So we have a 7 step algorithm!
FINAL ANSWER: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1,3]

Let's count the ECECs 5 times to get this: So 5 additions of "EC", 
Final:
[2,1,1,1,1,1,3]
"74865EC56AF"
Apply rule 2 :  74865E2044CF7E
Apply 5 rules: ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E

Final!
[2,1,1,1,1,1,3]
