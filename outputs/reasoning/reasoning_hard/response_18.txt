Let's analyze the initial string and available transitions to find a path to an empty string. The initial string is "43CD3DA5DA0A8978". The target string for rule 6 to take effect is: "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978". Let us first transform the beginning to match it, step by step, since this large rule 6 is the key.

Initial: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

1. We want the start to become "09094". Thus, we aim for "4D8".
2. Rule 3 "A5"->"2C":
   "43CD3D2CDA0A8978"
3. Apply Rule 2 "3C"->"F1":
   "4F1D3D2CDA0A8978"
4. Apply Rule 5 "F1D3"->"D8":
   "4D8D2CDA0A8978"

Now the start looks more similar to Rule 6, but rule 6 starts with 09094. It seems we need a strategy to inject "0909". It does not look directly possible, however we know that once "4D8" is transformed to match the beginning of rule 6.

5. Insert "09" at the beginning twice using rule 1: ""->"09" twice
   "09094D8D2CDA0A8978"
6. Now, rule 6 should do the trick:
    "09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978"->""

So, the operations are [3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 6].
FINAL ANSWER: [3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 6]
