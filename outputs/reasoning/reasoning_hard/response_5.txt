Okay, let's solve this puzzle. The initial string is "16323E51" and the goal is to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions. We must apply the transitions in the right sequence.

1.  **"16323E51" -> "16A323E51"** Applying transition 1) "3"->"A3".

2.  **"16A323E51" -> "16A3C151"** Applying transition 2) "23E"->"C1".

3.  **"16A3C151" -> "16A13C151"** Applying transition 3) "A"->"A1".

4.  **"16A1AAC151" -> "16A1AAC976CC"** Applying transition 5) "13"->"AA"

5.  **"16A1AAC976CC" -> ""** Applying transition 6) "16A1AAC976CC"->""

Therefore, the solution is: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
