Okay, let's analyze the problem and find a sequence of transitions to convert "27B39FE" to an empty string.

Available transitions:
1) ""->"07"
2) "0727B3"->"6C57"
3) "C579F"->"ED2C2F7"
4) "0707076ED2C2F7E"->""

Initial string: "27B39FE"

First, let's analyze the target of an empty string "", and work backwards.
The only transition leading to an empty string is rule 4: "0707076ED2C2F7E"->"". This means at some point we have to create the sequence "0707076ED2C2F7E".

Let's try building up the target string from the initial string using the transitions.

1. We have "27B39FE". Rule 2 involves "27B3" and leads to a 'C57' after having a "07". Perhaps the start needs modification.

Apply transition 1 ( ""->"07" ):
"27B39FE" -> "0727B39FE"

Apply transition 2 ( "0727B3"->"6C57" ):
"0727B39FE" -> "6C579FE"

Now we have "6C579FE". Rule 3 can apply to 'C579F'.
Apply transition 3 ( "C579F"->"ED2C2F7" ):
"6C579FE" -> "6ED2C2F7E"

We have "6ED2C2F7E". We want "0707076ED2C2F7E".  We are only missing "070707".
Apply transition 1: ""->"07" three times at the start of string. Since, transition applies only to first match, add one "07" at a time by matching on empty string at start.
-> Apply transition 1:  "6ED2C2F7E" -> "076ED2C2F7E"
-> Apply transition 1:  "076ED2C2F7E" -> "07076ED2C2F7E"
-> Apply transition 1: "07076ED2C2F7E" -> "0707076ED2C2F7E"

Now we have "0707076ED2C2F7E". We can apply rule 4.
Apply transition 4: "0707076ED2C2F7E" -> ""

The final sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4]}$
