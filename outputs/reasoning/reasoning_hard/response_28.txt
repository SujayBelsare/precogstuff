Let's analyze the initial string "070B6C4" and the available transitions to find a path to the empty string.

1. **070B6C4**: We start with the initial string. Notice "C4" is a possible transformation using rule 1.
2. **070B6B1E**: Applying rule 1 ("C4"->"B1E") transforms the string to "070B6B1E". Now "70" can be applied via rule 2.
3. **0DEB6B1E**: Rule 2 ("70"->"DE") gives us "0DEB6B1E". The character 'E' can be turned into '27' with Rule 3.
4. **0D27B6B127**: Applying rule 3 ("E"->"27") gives us "0D27B6B127". Rule 5 appears promising as "B1" is contained in the string, so lets attempt to apply Rule 5 next.
5. **0D27B6CD927**: Applying rule 5 ("B1"->"CD9") leads to "0D27B6CD927". Now let us examine other "E" available to use rule 3. This rule does not seem helpful at all, but, rather makes things worse as there is no apparent transition where "27" might be reduced to become an empty string.
6. Looking at rule 6. it ends with "27", rule 4 produces a result that also creates "27" at the end, hence the rule has possibility of being used at any step. Perhaps this could be used somewhere along the line and get closer to the solution. The string has "27B" which can be reduced.
7. **0D1D6CD927**: "27B"->"1D", now we apply rule 4. So far so good, using [1,2,3,5,4] looks very similar to rule 6.
8. "0D1D6CD927": From this we can transform using rule 6 "0D1D6CD927"->"".

So the series of application is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6]
