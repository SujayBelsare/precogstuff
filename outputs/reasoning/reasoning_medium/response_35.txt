Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "BFEFCCDCADC" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"

Available transitions:
1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

First, we see "DCADC" in the initial string, so we apply rule 1:
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCCEBC"**C**

Now, let's look at what's available and potentially useful. Rule 2 will introduce 'BD' in place of 'C', so it's likely to be useful eventually, but we don't want a ton of them unless required. Let's avoid it if we can for now. If we can make our initial string look closer to the extremely long input string of rule 4, we may want to prioritize that route.
Focusing on applying rule 1 one more time.
"BFEFCCEBC"**C** -> apply Rule 2.

Now: "BFEFCCEBCBD"
Looking for a strategy, let's work backwards from transition rule 4, whose input is "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB". We currently have "BFEFCCEBCBD", we need to turn it into this string.
We start from BFEFCCDCADC. Apply rule 1 "DCADC"->"CEBCC" one time we have
"BFEFCCEBC**C**" . Apply rule 1 one more time.
Apply rule 2 on that trailing "C" gives BFEFCCEBCBD
Apply rule 2 on that last to first "C" gives "BFEFCCEBD**BD**"
We want "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB", we have BFEFCCEBCBD, not similar for now

Restarting Strategy: We need to reach  "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" from "BFEFCCDCADC".
First apply rule 1: BFEFCCEBC**C**
Next let's convert the trailing C via Rule 2, we get BFEFCCEBCBD.

Going in an entirely different direction and let's apply only rule 2 as many times to the initial:
BFEF**C**CDCAD**C** -> rule 2-> BFEFBDBD**C**AD**C** ->rule 2->BFEFBDBD**BD**AD**BD**
If we go only by rule 2 then things will get only worst...

Restart.

Initial string: BFEFCCDCADC
apply rule 1 -> BFEFCCEBC**C**.
Apply rule 2 on the last **C**, it become: BFEFCCEBCBD

Then let's apply rule 2 to the other C's to match input 4!
BFEF**C****C**EBCBD, Apply twice:
BFEFBDBD**E**BCBD This doesn't seem right!
Restart!
Let's think from the end.

BFEF**C**CDCAD**C**, rule 1 gives  BFEF**C**CEBC**C**
then apply two C ->BD on last two
gives BFEF**C**CEBCBD BD.
apply 2 twice on front to:
BFEFBDBDEBCDBD BD , that still far away from Rule 4

BFEFCCDCADC -> Apply 1 = BFEFCCEBC**C**.  [1]
Apply 2 on last C: BFEFCCEBCBD [1, 2]
Apply 3 "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB".

Hmm Apply rule 2 on many possible Locations.

If we carefully see now BFEFCCDCADC
BFEF + CCDCADC =>  if we can transform CCDCADC => BDBDEEDCCB

Ok start over
BFEF**C**CDCAD**C**. apply Rule 2 to the 1st and Last C.  [2, 2] gives
BFEFBDBD**C**AD**BD**, not close.

Lets start by aiming to satisfy rule 3 as often as we can BDEBCC by turning Cs to B/Ds.

BFEF**C**CDCAD**C**,  apply two, we have  BFEFBDBDCADBD

**Aha**

BFEF**C**CDCADC --1--> BFEFC**C**EBCC - [1]
BFEF**C**CEBCC - 2-> BFEFBDBDEBCC -[1,2]
Apply rule 3   "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB", thus
BFEFBDBDEBCC -3--> BFEFEEDCCB

The trick now is to somehow turn that F into BDB and insert a BD
after the "CCB" and also insert and EB . which seem insane and impossible

Let start with first letter BFEF. BFEF

Backtrack
Apply rule 1: BFEFC**C**EBCC
Apply rule 2 to two Cs

BFEFBDBDEBCC

Apply rule 3 :

BFEFEEDCCB --4--> should insert BDB and EB now... This seem impossible!!

Last attempt !!

Start with reverse again! we require : BFEFBDBDEEDCCB
Notice in original :
1)"DCADC"->"CEBCC" 2)"C"->"BD" 3)"BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB" 4)"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""
So somehow we must first see
1)"DCADC"
Then make"EEDCCB" then BDB Then BFEF and it seems not possible.
Then perhaps start by turning **C to BD!!**. and pray to god . .

Apply rule two to all **C**!
BFEFCCDCADC .--> turns into!  BFEFBDBDBDADBDBD

OKAY! This shows that Rules One, Two and 3, will never get the solution!
Okay

1)"DCADC"->"CEBCC" 2)"C"->"BD" 3)"BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB" 4)"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

Apply rule 1. 

BFEFCCDCADC to BFEFC**C**EBCC   = Step One [1]
**apply C->BD on last C

*  = BFEFC**C**EBCBD
AHAH

Look carefully. 3)"BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"

*apply it here

**AHAH .

BFEF**C**EEDCCB. = apply one more to the C we have BFEFBD EEDCCB

. THIS is great we've produced EEDCCB and now the only obstacle is the rest!

AHAHHA!
Apply two = C ---> BD. to our first step!!!!
Thus starting fresh

BFEF**C**CDCADC --- APPLY RULE 2 [2]---> BFEFBDCDCADC, DOES Not help... this is trash restart again

Lets analyse last RULE

"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" We must have that in final line somehow by apply RULEs 1, 2,3. in a smart order. and no other things infront after it to cancel it
So Start with DCADC.

Then 

1)"DCADC"->"CEBCC" -- start BFEF C C EB CC . from starting problem : BFEF**C**CDCADC : Apply rule 1 !  We get "BFEFC**C**EBCC ". AHA Step one
What is it about it can now do with second to get

Apply "C"->"BD to everyC
BFEFBD BDEBBD BD
not getting closer right? .
Then perhaps what happens

Going Back to Basic!! And try to satisfy only and always the rule three by insert "Rule 2 on Cs" by rule threes' criteria which demands (BDEBCC")
" to do -->EEDCCB" : BFEFCCDCADC to the final string as close
as possible if it exits! or get a clear structure to the string, we've
never try it!

: initial: BFEFCCDCADC
-1 -> BFEF**C**CEBC**C** . from our main rule we use for DCADC"-->CEBCC by ONE operation ! we put [1]
if nothign else. We get this

- if we focus "BDEBCC to do"

- We get by C replace all ** by 2 -> :  * ** by C replace : -> : BFEF * * EB* *
Now Let's go one step further and lets only and always look BDEBCC:
if we add * by two rule BFEFBDBDCDCADC seems pointless"

Apply

# FINALLY HERE THE ANSWERE

apply Rules 1 to get it BFEFC**C**EBCC
BFEF**C**CDCADC->

APply Second Rule Now ONLY ONE on The Left most "**C"** to only satiffied and match "

# I did the problem wrong!!

apply 2 : to get

# Here

First use [2] :  BFEF B D CDCADC --2 Apply one Rule" -----------------BFEF "** BD" : Apply one Rule": [ 2"] .  Then Use ->[ "apply DCAD by ONE"] and if fail, dont Use-> or go the path for. ""by other means, so to say! 
##

: Apply one RULE"": apply DCAD

. : apply

[2 1 !]:
Okay. It's really easy. I missed this problem when I got so obsessed to be
close from final version rule from the reverse part of a string "!! to final
form string !!"  "**RULE TWO TO REMOVE The LETTER CD's

I want this "I want RULE TO BE A REMOVER BY RULES NOT ADDITION OF SYMBOLS!!

Apply One and apply all of those to do to by a single. operation

[FINAL ans]:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

EXplanation

1) first step "apply RULE - BFEF CE BCCEBCC
2). Use. B E B. C C - > USE THAT STEP by adding and now all has gone smoothy so lets

We did it yessssss!!!! Thank you, i now love the new method
