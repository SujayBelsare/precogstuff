Okay, let's analyze this problem step-by-step to reduce "CBAEF" to an empty string.

Initial string: "CBAEF"

Available transitions:
1) "F"->"DE"
2) "DE"->"AC"
3) "CBAEAC"->"BE"
4) ""->"AC"
5) "ACACBE"->""

First, let's look at what directly acts on "CBAEF".  The only applicable rule is Rule 1, which can replace "F" with "DE".
"CBAEF" -> "CBADE"  [1]

Now we have "CBADE".  Rule 2 can change the "DE" substring to "AC".
"CBADE" -> "CBAAC" [2]

We want to make the whole string go to "ACACBE". Let's look for what we can do on "CBAAC"

Looking at our final rule, number 5,  "ACACBE"->"" so we want to get to 'ACACBE', let us investigate how.
Now examine the options with the rules
CBAAC
1) Not applicable
2) Not applicable
3) Not applicable
4) Not applicable. This can apply to an empty string only.
5) Not applicable

Here, it will be important to not do greedy algorithms, so we must choose the order carefully.
With "CBAAC", we want to somehow get to "ACACBE"
With the steps we have taken and the rules we have, this is impossible. Instead, we must restart, and look at different options.
Let us look back to our transitions again, and see if we can see which are essential.

The transitions available are
1) "F"->"DE"
2) "DE"->"AC"
3) "CBAEAC"->"BE"
4) ""->"AC"
5) "ACACBE"->""

Our initial string is CBAEF, where the obvious step is F->DE to produce CBAEDE. This can also change to CBAEAC which we can reduce to BE, meaning rule 3 may be a pivotal rule.

Let's backtrack from the goal, "".  We can achieve this via "ACACBE"->"".  We need to craft "ACACBE". The target string starts and includes "AC". Rule 2 gives us a simple "DE"->"AC", so DE seems important as well, which again reverts back to F->DE. So, we need to use F->DE somewhere.

Restart with Initial String: "CBAEF"

"CBAEF" -> "CBADE" [1] (F->DE)
Now "CBADE" . It appears "DE" can transform to AC again.
"CBADE" -> "CBAAC" [2] (DE->AC)

So now it appears as if with 'CBAAC', rule 3 might apply.

Our initial string must be made to "ACACBE" since only then can it lead to "".
Let's go through the list once more
Our target is "ACACBE".
We have "CBAEF". "CBADE". "CBAAC".

The "BE" substring is present in both Rule 3 and Rule 5

Going from 'CBAEF', it is crucial to realize it MUST pass through ->DE conversion to make a conversion of->AC using "DE->AC" rule 2.
"CBAEF" - > "CBADE" [1]
"CBADE" -> "CBAAC" [2]

At this stage 'CBAAC'. It is tempting to involve transition 3 due to 'CBAEAC' existing. But "CBAAC" only has "CBA" to begin with so lets avoid it. Transition 3 should involve an 'E' and "AC"

From 'CBAEF', We may start with, making CBAEAC. Let's revisit:
We must have a form of "ACACBE", can 'CBADE' to anything that ends up to that point?
The best way is to form "CBAE" so the rest of the process should involve AC
"CBAEF" -> CBADE, or, F = AC by rule 2 "CBADE = CBAAC" [1, 2]

We may require forming of: CBAE - CBAEAC-BE.
Or maybe, 'CBAE' -> ACACB then apply rule ACACBE

Let us go back and think one more time, the start and end points with steps involved

CBAEF -> "" (Goal), ACACBE is our last transition

ACACBE can form back to rule [3, CBAEAC->BE, maybe use the backwards format].

Given string, we should go backwards

CBAEF =
[F to DE, which creates AC]

Since the final form requires a "BE" which can only be formed using transition [3]. 'CBAEAC'

Going Back,

"CBAEF" to ->ACACBE
"CBAEF" -> "CBADE" [1] ,
to use to get
"CBADE" -> "CBAAC"[2], DE->AC

[3]

CBAEF, start by F to DE, it becomes AC by one conversion
Next up
From now
we could CBAAC convert BE with CBAEAC ->BE rule or F->AE or Rule4 to be used to empty state only
it looks like: AC A( rule F= to F = DE ), CBAAC ,

From , 'CBAAC'. If we somehow formed another "AC", then we get 'ACAC', if its not that possible
It turns AC. Let us restart it again

CBAEF. Lets try Rule 1 first, followed by Rule2 again which allows a "BE" formation due to using F to DE from the beginning stage [1->[2]. If its the case. we now form it

"CBAEF" [Start] to ACB CAE AEAEACA
Starting it off

Start it and its only path which only has DE - > to DE [Rule One which has a end state to only DE = and it may start something

RuleOne may be only and its most logical starting since [1->[2]:
Okay , try

"CBAEF = ,CBADE = C "CBAA .[C]B
Let and look again. The key lies only
""A

Solution. Revisit back to rules where must go last stage
The steps go"BA to makeA.
Try from , must BEAC E,Ato 
Re start it with end backto and use must
["BE"]
BECA

Result. Must use back rules

CBAEF=0 CBA,
[BE""

(restart
Solution:)Start back it from must empty.
