Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We have the following transitions:

1) "DFDF"->"EF"
2) "C"->"DD"
3) "DEF"->"CAFA"
4) "AF"->"EF"
5) "DDDEFA"->""

And the initial string: "CDFDF"

Our goal is to reduce "CDFDF" to "".

Let's try a few approaches. We could try to find patterns that will lead us to using rule 5, as that's our target string.

CDFDF -> (Rule 2) -> DDFDF
Now let's consider applying rule 1 or 3 to reduce this.

Let's consider the sequence using Rule 2 first:
CDFDF -> (Rule 2) DDDFDF
This doesn't directly allow any other transformations to the front. Let's consider transforming DFDF directly.

CDFDF -> (Rule 1) CEF
Now we can try to obtain the string "DDDEFA"

CEF...

Let's explore another path
CDFDF -> DDDFDF, but also,
Let's focus on building DDDEFA from our current starting point: CDFDF
CDFDF->DDDFDF; Now we need EA somewhere. If we use rule 3 we obtain DE=CAFA.

How about the following

CDFDF -> (2) DDDFDF
DDDFDF -> No rules can directly convert. Let's apply rule 1 with foresight. How can CDFDF become 'DFDF' in the first position. Not easy

Back to the original consideration of
CDFDF -> (1) CEF;
Now how can this generate our sequence? 

If we reverse Rule 3: AFAC<-FED. I think it could be a false lead.

Okay new tactic. What does it take to create the pattern of rule 5: DDDEFA
If we see "C," it MUST be converted to DD by Rule 2.
If we see AF, it becomes EF according to Rule 4.

Let's try another round using the rule:

CDFDF -> (2) DDDFDF.
Now, consider if it becomes DDDEFA, it will require rule 3 at some point.

Let us try the following solution
1) C -> DD (rule 2).
2) DDDFDF -> transform to DDDEFA via rule 3? The 3rd rule requires 'DEF.'
3) Rule 4 states AF -> EF; DDDFDF requires AF after. DDFDF will also need something else, for a transition involving DEF
4) How about DDDFDF->convert 'DF'-> EF?

Start again, and attempt to create that pattern using "Rule 3, "DEF"->"CAFA." from the initial CDFDF,
First we need DEF somehow

CDFDF = CD + FDF, so let's obtain DE. or DD from rule 2, using FDF instead to make "F" = D to get DEF, that's where it ends

Starting again to generate DDDEFA for Rule 5:

CDFDF ->
DD + DFDF(via rule 2)
DDDFDF -> use Rule 1 which does not seem helpful (i.e: replace DFDF-> EF, i.e. DDEF, no)
The way out from here could come from using rule 3, using "DEF", but the existing form (DDDFDF) has not 'DEF'
Another solution comes from CDFDF becoming CDFDF-> CEF then something ->"DDDEFA".
Rule 4 also helps (AF->EF)

Consider CDFDF = CD + FDF -> DDF + DF = DDDFF (No)
Therefore, let me rethink and see if rule 5 actually works with rule 3? DDDEFA

**Correct Solution:**
1. **C -> DD (Rule 2):** "CDFDF" becomes "DDDFDF"
2. **DFDF -> EF (Rule 1):** "DDDFDF" becomes "DDEF"
3. **DEF -> CAFA (Rule 3):** "DDEF" becomes "DCAFA"
4. **AF -> EF (Rule 4):** "DCAFA" becomes "DCEFA"
5. **C-> DD (Rule 2):** "DCEFA" becomes "DDDEFA"
6. **DDDEFA -> "" (Rule 5):** ""

Therefore the correct solution is:
[2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
