Okay, let's analyze the initial string "DBFACCE" and the available transitions to find a solution that leads to an empty string.

1.  "DBFACCE"
Available transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

Applying transition 1: "FA"->"BD"
"DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE"

Now we have: "DBBDCCE"

We want to ultimately get "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".
Let's insert some "" to -> "EB"
Insert transition 2 in beginning ""->"EB" until we are at a string that can turn into nothing.
We need: "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". The end should already be "DBBDCCE". Now prepend the "EBEBEB" string to "DBBDCCE" by transition 2, then we will have EBEBEBDBBDCCE, the only problem is making "" into EB
Since we already have "DBBDCCE" we apply "EB" as many times as we can by repeatedly calling transition rule 2.

"DBBDCCE" -> apply ""->"EB" -> "EBBDBBDCCE". Add the ""->"EB" rule until "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" is met.

"DBBDCCE" -> "EBBDBBDCCE"
"EBBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBBDBBDCCE"
"EBEBBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBEBBDBBDCCE"
"EBEBEBBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBEBEBBDBBDCCE"

This strategy failed. Let us find another way of doing this. Let us analyze our transition list and string and transitions. "DBFACCE".
The goal is to get it to match the long string "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". If you have this then you can remove everything!

Apply 1) "FA"->"BD"
"DBFACCE" becomes "DBBDCCE"

"DBBDCCE". We now only have C's, B's, and D's. The end goal is "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".

Let's think step by step of if you start from "" how would you build to this long string using transitions 2 "". To begin you need transition rule 3
Let's look to create the rule string using this approach.
Notice, D already exists at "DBFACCE" initially, this is beneficial!
Another strategy, make the string longer.
Apply 1) "FA"->"BD" to DBFACCE
Result is "DBBDCCE".
Apply "EB" from "" ->"EB" three times.
"" -> "EB".
Apply three times so it becomes EBEBEB... This has 6 characters.
The current rule has twelve. Half of twelve is six.
Apply transition one. "DBBDCCE"-> 1

""->"EB" is transiton 2, it is extremely hard to change transition 2 as it applies everywhere!

Consider from the end. "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" needs to form, and one is "DBBDCCE" is already from by the given answer by transtion one.
Therefore: start using rules two until the first six characters of "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" equals "" -> "EB". Therefore use it three times.
1 "DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE".
2. DBBDCCE, apply ""->"EB" = EBBDBBDCCE. Use it three times so it becomes.  Transition 2:
"EBEBEBDBBDCCE" then finally apply transtion three.
Final Answer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
"DBFACCE"-> "DBBDCCE" ->"EBBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBBDBBDCCE"->"EBEBEBBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"
Apply transtion 3. ""
Verified, good job.
