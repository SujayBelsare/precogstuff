Let's analyze the given transitions and initial string to find a sequence that leads to an empty string.

Initial string: "AFCAE"
Available transitions:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

Notice transition 2 requires the entire string to be "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". We cannot directly use transition 2 as our initial string is "AFCAE". The only option to transform "AFCAE" into the empty string is to insert certain strings using transformation 1 and apply transition 2 repeatedly after each insertion (this method doesn't work).

There seems to be no direct or simple solution using insertion with transformation 1. However, we are aiming for an empty string, "" and our only useful transformation is transformation 2, where the only solution will always contain transformation 2 at the end. Therefore, we need to insert strings using transofmration 1 repeatedly until we end up at "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".

Let's see what transformation 1 provides:
""->"BC"

Therefore, we need to figure out how many insertions we need to make. We can only make the number of insertions until the entire initial string, i.e., "AFCAE" is "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"

Since transformation 1 adds "BC" to empty string.

Let x = The number of times to call transformation 1.

Initial string = AFCAE. Desired String = BCBCBCBCAFCAE. Length difference in characters = 9
The number of "BC" that must be created is 9 characters. We can call transition 1 some amount of times:

Transformation 1 transforms: "" -> "BC"
Transformation 2 transforms: "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" -> ""

"AFCAE" has length of 5
"BCBCBCBCAFCAE" has length of 14 = 5+9=5+3*3 = length(AFCAE) + 3*"BC"

If transformation 1 is only creating 'BC' in emptiness and not based on existing strings, we should use it and try transformation 2 when 'AFCAE' is "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".

Since we cannot directly apply transition 1 (""->"BC") to our initial string since there must be nothing in order for this transformation to work, that means we somehow are doing the transformations incorrectly and this sed puzzle is unsolvable. However, this can't be since the prompt says so.

Let's try a different approach. We cannot just do nothing and expect transformation 2 to transform into nothing.

It seems I made a mistake. Transition 1 is impossible. It converts the empty string to BC, however, an empty string can only be an empty string; therefore transformation 1 has no effect.
Given we can't apply transition 1 and only 2. The answer is not solvable

Therefore the answer is not solvable and unsolvable. Let me re-reason,
"AFCAE" length = 5. "" length = 0, hence there's a different of -5

The initial string is AFCAE
The target string is ""

The avaliable operations
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""
Length 2 transformations that inserts at an EMPTY SPOT
Length -14 removes from BCBCBCBCAFCAE.
Since ""->"BC" only operates when the expression has nothing to it. And "AFCAE" never has nothing on it. AFCAE can never be removed and we can't use the 2nd tranformation without it reading"BCBCBCBCAFCAE". We cannot get to transformation 2 ever with transformation 1. Therefore, our endgoal can never be reached.

UNSOLVABLE
Since that is not a solution, and all problems are meant to be solvable I must be wrong again.

The rules say: "Each transition modifies only the first matching substring."

Okay what if we view an implicit string being everywhere
"" <-AFCAE->""
transition 1 affects leftmost such. Transition 2 affects the existing expression if the expressions equals BCBCBCBCAFCAE

"AFCAE"
If transformation 1 somehow makes the string start with "" BC, then "BCAFCAE" is impossible. However lets explore this possibility,
It seems that we never use transformation 1 and our expression will equal BCAFCAE therefore the final string will never be reached.

We note that transition 1 converts the EMPTY STRING to BC, and transition 2 reduces the whole thing to an EMPTY STRING. Thus we see transition 1 inserts to empty string

"AFCAE" with transformation one creates "BCAFCAE" after one run? And 3 runs turns it into "BCBCCBCAFCAE"? no!
Let's make "AFCAE" into a "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" from the LEFT:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""
Initial string: "AFCAE"
We want :  "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"

There doesn't appear to be any method for transformation. Therefore it remains UNANSWERABLE.

Since the sed puzzle is not solvable with the existing transformations and the sed champion does not know what to do.
