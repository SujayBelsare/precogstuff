Okay, I understand the Sed Puzzle Game. I must transform the initial string "EDDAC" into an empty string "" using the provided transitions, applying them one at a time to the first matching substring. I need to reason carefully and provide a valid sequence of transitions. Any incorrect step leads to immediate failure. Let's begin.

Initial string: "EDDAC"

1. Apply transition 1 ("EDDA"->"FF"): "EDDAC" becomes "FFC".

Current string: "FFC"

2. Apply transition 2 ("C"->"CD"): "FFC" becomes "FFCD".

Current string: "FFCD"

3. Apply transition 2 ("C"->"CD"): "FFCD" becomes "FFCDD".

Current string: "FFCDD"

4. Apply transition 2 ("C"->"CD"): "FFCDD" becomes "FFCDDD".

Current string: "FFCDDD"

5. Apply transition 3 ("FFCDDD"->"" ): "FFCDDD" becomes "".

Current string: ""

The sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}$
