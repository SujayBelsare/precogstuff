Okay, I understand. I must find a sequence of transitions that converts "BDACCEFEFBD" to "". Let's proceed cautiously.

Initial string: "BDACCEFEFBD"

1.  Look for applicable transitions. Transition 1 requires "EFEFBD". The initial string *does* contain "EFEFBD" at index 6. Applying transition 1 would change the string to: "BDACCDDBD".

2.  New string: "BDACCDDBD"
    Look for applicable transitions. None of them immediately match. I need an "AE" sequence.

3. Going back to the initial state, "BDACCEFEFBD" . I will try to apply transition 3 backwards. Applying transition 3 in reverse could create "BAEACCAEAEBD". I will use the current transitions I am provided and avoid backwards solving. I made an error.
4. I can apply transition 1, which is EFEFBD -> DDBD. Resulting in "BDACCDDBD"

5. I am noticing the initial string can not easily utilize any transitions other than the first. It would be simpler to remove the BD portions of the string if possible by trying to change the string to have 'BAEACCAEAEBD' somewhere within its expression. I notice that transition number 2 results in 'D' -> 'AE'. I might be able to apply this strategy to reduce the string such that only transition 3 is usable to fully evaluate.

6. Let me perform this change to the initial equation "BDACCEFEFBD". In this expression, I must first change transition 2, 'D' -> 'AE' to replace the expression with 'AE'. Resulting in "BAECCEFEFAEBAE".

7. Now, I will look for any similar string as required in rule 3, which is equal to 'BAEACCAEAEBD'. The new string does not match. Let me reasses to see if there are other ways to find better solutions. Going back to step 4. String now equals "BDACCDDBD" after transition one.

8. Still equals "BDACCDDBD" after transition 1. Let us focus on reducing the problem expression such that we arrive to our desired outcome with less steps. In this case, I will evaluate backwards. Given final result is empty string.

9. To solve in the correct direction and arrive to the empty string state we require to remove this portion 'BAEACCAEAEBD'. In doing so, lets replace it with nothing. Thus, "BDACCEFEFBD" requires to transition to BAEACCAEAEBD for us to achieve success. Lets focus on the solution that we are aiming for: "BDACCEFEFBD" transitions to "BAEACCAEAEBD", such that a further transition can reduce the full expression to a null character. Lets verify that we can evaluate to that case.

10. Review of Transition 1 to 3

    *   "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
    *   "D"->"AE"
    *   "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""

11. Since none of the transitions results in an immediate match I will look for ways to decompose the transition through the insertion and modification steps for the expressions available. In this case I should focus on evaluating and changing the expression in relation to the strings that the transformation allow.

12. "BDACCEFEFBD"
    I notice that the string contains "D". Let's apply transition 2: D -> AE. The "D" closest to the front of the string is at index 0.
    "AEACCEFEFBD"

13. "AEACCEFEFBD"
    Transition 1 cannot be used yet because we need EFEFBD.  Transition 2 replaces "D" with "AE".  Transition 3 can not be used.  Let's apply transition 1 by modifying.
    Since applying transition two does not further optimize the case, let's not pursue it for now. Reverting to initial state

14. "BDACCEFEFBD"
    Apply transition 1 to EFEFBD, giving:
    "BDACCDDBD"

15. "BDACCDDBD"
    Apply transition 2 twice to change the two "D"s nearest to the front, converting them to "AE".
    "BAEACC AE AEBD"

16. "BAEACC AE AEBD"
    Let's retry this path starting from step 14 again with an iterative refinement to determine a minimal solution.
    "BDACCEFEFBD"
    "BDACCDDBD" (Transition 1)

    Apply transition 2 twice:
    "BAEACC AE AEBD"

    Transition 3 will still not work

    "BDACCEFEFBD"
    Try this: Transition 1. EFEFBD -> DDBD
    "BDACCDDBD"
    Apply transition 2 (D->AE):
    "BAEACCDDBD"
    Apply transition 2 again (D->AE):
    "BAEACC AE DBD"
    Apply transition 2 again (D->AE):
    "BAEACC AE AE BD"
    Apply transition 2 again (D->AE):
    "BAEACC AE AE AE" Still transition 3 not met.

17.  Given that the solution seems to involve turning D's into AE and that Transition 3 only consumes strings that already have the pattern 'BAEACCAEAEBD'.
Let me reason with the idea that "DDBD" in transition 1 provides a step that removes information compared to transition 2 that inserts more characters. Hence let's remove transition 2 for now.

"BDACCEFEFBD" -> ""
Transition 1. is "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
Let us start backwards.

BAEACCAEAEBD
Apply transition 2 to reduce the string's possible length of substrings. Transition 2 replaces "D"->"AE" thus reducing can only result from transition 1.

I suspect a loop here. I should be using an existing approach to achieve correct ordering without backtracking.

BDACCEFEFBD
Let's consider replacing all of Ds in the main string "BDACCEFEFBD". Apply transition two to modify the expression. Let me apply the D to all of the variables in the equation: Resulting in
"BAEACC AEFEFBAE"
There doesn't seem to be any improvement from these substitutions. Let me try applying transformation one on the expression before.
"BDACCEFEFBD"

1.  Transition one requires for substring to equal the variable of evaluation: 'EFEFBD'. Evaluate based on substring equality.
2. Evaluate next potential moves after transition based on remaining actions and string composition.
3. When no more operations are required or transition leads back into the states that occur by redoing work. We should revert and redo initial transitions.

Initial Expression 'BDACCEFEFBD'
Transition 1
'BDACCDDBD'
Transition 2 Applied
'BAEACCDDBD'
Transition 2 Applied
'BAEACC AEDBD'
Transition 2 Applied
'BAEACC AEAED'
Transition 2 Applied
'BAEACC AEAEAE' Does not simplify string expression to what our required transition expression is 'BAEACCAEAEBD'

I notice that evaluating the EFEFDB pattern and then subsequent 'Ds' leads towards the closest solution that can utilize the available methods given in transition 1. This method does not however yield into the pattern that transition 3 will simplify to solve for ''.

Let me try backtracking through all available paths through available options. Let us start transition two such that D -> AE where applied across every 'D' parameter of original expression, 'BDACCEFEFBD'.
This results in changing D parameters with AE:
First Transition Applied is Two (to first occurence) D-> AE to get 'AEACCEFEFBD'

The solution still does not meet desired transformation to allow complete evaluations on the method described above.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}$
Final Solution below
"BDACCEFEFBD"
1. Apply transition 1 "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
Result "BDACCDDBD"

2. Apply transition 2 "D"->"AE"
Result "BAEACCDDBD"

3. Apply transition 2 "D"->"AE"
Result "BAEACC AEDBD"

4. Apply transition 2 "D"->"AE"
Result "BAEACC AEAEBD"

5. Apply transition 3 "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""
Result ""
Thus
[1,2,2,2,3]
