Okay, let's play the Sed Puzzle Game. My goal is to transform the initial string "FFADDAEEB" into an empty string "" using the provided transitions. I must be very careful in applying each transformation, as a single mistake will lead to failure.

Here's my attempt:

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

1. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
   String becomes: "FFADDAEEFB"

2. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
   String becomes: "FFADDAEEFFB"

3. Apply transition 3: "CEEF" -> "AF"
   String becomes: "FFADDAAFB"

4. Apply transition 2: "FADDA" -> "BDC"
   String becomes: "FFBDCAFB"

5. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
    String becomes: "FFBDCAFFB"

6. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
    String becomes: "FFBDCAFFFB"

7. Apply transition 3: "CEEF" -> "AF"
   This transition cannot be applied

8. Try something different: Apply transition 4 to the initial condition

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

1.  Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
    String becomes: "FFADDAEEFB"

2. Apply transition 3: "CEEF" -> "AF"
    This is not applicable.

3.  Try something different again

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

1.  Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
    String becomes: "FFADDAEEFB"

2.  Apply transition 3: "CEEF" -> "AF"
    This is not applicable

4.  Try another path. Notice that rule #4 eliminates patterns starting from the left side.  Can we get "FFBDAFFB"?

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

1. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
   String becomes: "FFADDAEEFB"

2.  Apply transition 3: "CEEF" -> "AF"
    The target substring isn't in the current state

3. Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

4.  Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
    "FFADDAEEFB"

5.  Transition 1: Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
   "FFADDAEEFFB"

6. Apply transition 3: "CEEF"->"AF"
"FFADDAAFB"

7. transition 2: "FADDA"->"BDC"
"FFBDCAFB"

8. Apply transition 1: "B" -> "FB"
"FFBDCAFFB"

Now can we generate the "FFBDAFFB"? It requires B in position 3.
It's still not very effective. Let me rethink my overall strategy.
Rule #4 means that FF...BDAFFB will become "". B must be preceded by FF, followed by DA, followed by FF...

Let's step back.

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"
1. Apply transition 1: "B"->"FB".  "FFADDAEEFB"
2. Transition 3 "CEEF" -> "AF" will never happen.
The 'A' must be cancelled at a stage like FFADDA...., implying the necessity for the presence of FADDA

I'm going to try solving backwards: I need to create FFBDAFFB at some point so it is deleted.
Thus I need to find some operation that creates an "FFBDAFFB" sequence from "FFADDAEEB".
Since "FFBDAFFB" goes to "" via transition 4, the presence of FF and B is more important at early stages.

Initial: "FFADDAEEB"
1. Apply 1. B->FB: "FFADDAEEFB"
2. CEEF doesn't exist
3. FADDA -> BDC: "FFBDCEEB"
4. Rule 4, which can cancel out the leftmost portion of length 8 can do no such thing.

Okay, I see. Rule 4 implies FF...BDA...FFB MUST exist to become an empty string! It has a critical portion, the BDA string, and some FF components that needs to exist. Can the FF be converted into single F? No. It starts with "F", ends with "B" after "A...AFFB". Thus if a valid transition set exists it should find "FFBDAFFB". Let's get serious and test!

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"

1. Apply transition 1: "B"->"FB" -> "FFADDAEEFB"

From this string, is it possible to obtain "FFBDAFFB" at some point so that it cancels? If "FFADDAEEFB" -> .... -> "FFBDAFFB" then "transition 4".

Initial String: "FFADDAEEB"
Transition 1: "FFADDAEEFB"
Let's find some other sequence.
Let's try the sequence [2, 1, 4] on "FFADDAEEB". Not directly possible due to the presence of EE between ADDA and B

FFADDAEEB -> Apply operation B to FB --> FFADDAEEFB
Applying operation "CEEF"->"AF" leads to "FFADDAA" which is not viable because FF cannot be cancelled. So transition 3 is of negligible benefit in our transformation.
Trying to get AFFB through CEEF is also nearly impossible. Because the location where such transformation can take place isn't possible to construct. FADDA or BDC operation is required. But FADDA is preceded by FF while ADDA has other characters. And can not find BDCAFFB

Let us reconsider something. Can we apply transition #4 at least once in such cases?? Can such combinations generate this combination that removes the strings? The answer is still difficult. If we are asked to evaluate something. We should find cases to remove items using rule #4. The other transition rules seem rather unhelpful.

It appears that the goal is to convert parts of the string to contain FFBDAFFB so it becomes "", which is achievable after 4 steps as specified in Rule 4. To do this. It requires 'B' between FF and DA. So

[1, 3] cannot do the task, therefore [1] must follow some rule that transforms FADDA or BDA sequences using rule #2 and rules to introduce "F" appropriately such as "CEEF" operations or to delete existing characters and transform to fit appropriately.

Based on the rules FF..B DA.. A FF.. B

It turns out FADDA to BDC looks extremely viable for conversion:FF (FADDA) EEFB
FF (BDC) EEFB - Then apply Transition operation B again! B -> FB! FFBDCEEFFB which again... leads to more complexity than solving the simple FFADDA pattern problem at hand:
Let us proceed with one solution strategy "FFADDA(EEB)".
We need it be in the order FF ... B DA

1 - "FFADDAEEB"

This problem will NOT be solvable or very unsolvable using only sequential method operations by considering sequential transformations!
The correct solution should contain transformations on the strings. In theory this would not be sequential rules

I am not confident about my previous attempts, it is a bit challenging without proper abstraction!
So I admit that I cannot find the valid list.
