Okay, I understand the Sed Puzzle Game. My objective is to transform the initial string "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" into an empty string "" by applying the given transitions one at a time, modifying only the first matching substring. I must be precise and avoid errors. Here we go.

Initial String: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

1. **Look for applicable transitions:**  We scan the transitions to see if any match the beginning of the initial string.
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

2. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" becomes "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF9785FF"
    * Current String: "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF9785FF"

3. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - We have a match! Applying transition 3.

4. **Apply transition 3:**  "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF9785FF" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF9785FF"
    * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF9785FF"

5. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

6. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF9785FF" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF"
   * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF"

7. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

8. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF5FF"
   * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF5FF"

9. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

10. **Apply transition 4:** "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF5FF" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF5FF5FF"
    * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF5FF5FF5FF"

11. **Look for applicable transitions:**
     * ""->"09" - No match.
     * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
     * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
     * "8"->"5FF" - No match.
     * "F1D3"->"D8" - No match.

I've made an error in my previous reasoning by repeatedly applying transition 4 without a clear path toward using transition 6. The '8' occurrences were added and did not exist in the first place. Time to take a different approach.
Let's restart and prioritize using transition 6 when its pre-requisites show up.

Initial string: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

1. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * "A5"->"2C" - We have a match! Applying transition 3.

2. **Apply transition 3:**  "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A8978"
    * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A8978"

3. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

4. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A8978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978"
    * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978"

5. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * "A5"->"2C" - We have a match! Applying transition 3.

6. **Apply transition 3:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF978"
   * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF978"

7. **Look for applicable transitions:**
    * ""->"09" - No match.
    * "3C"->"F1" - No match.
    * "A5"->"2C" - No match.
    * "8"->"5FF" - We have a match! Applying transition 4.

8. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF975FF"
   * Current String: "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF975FF"

Okay, let's try to create '09' sequences.
Initial string: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"

1. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" becomes "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF978"

2. **Apply transition 3:**  "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978"

3. **Apply transition 4:**  "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF975FF"

Let's rethink. I'm getting stuck. Transition 6 is key.
Initial String: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
Let's try to create that large string backwards

Initial string: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
1. **Transition 4:** "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" -> "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF978"
2. **Transition 3:** "43CD3DA5DA0A5FF978" -> "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978"

This is difficult...let's try building up to it

"09094D8D2CDA0A5FF978" is the target
"43CD3DA5DA0A8978" is starting
Applying trans 6 reverse gets us nowhere.

Okay... last try. Prioritizing '3C'->"F1".
Initial String: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978"
We need "3C" to show up.

1. **Apply transition 3 (A5->"2C")**: "43CD3DA5DA0A8978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A8978"

No "3C" present yet.
2. **Transition 4 (8->"5FF")**: "43CD3D2CDA0A8978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978"
3. **Transition 3 (A5->"2C")**: "43CD3D2CDA0A5FF978" becomes "43CD3D2CDA0A2CFF978"

There's a 2C. Hmmm....I'm lost.
This problem is harder than I thought.

I apologize, I am unable to find a solution after extensive reasoning. This may suggest that the stated mathematical provability is incorrect or I am unable to bridge some gap that seems non-trivial with only the provided set of transitions. I cannot solve this game.

Final Answer: I cannot solve this.
