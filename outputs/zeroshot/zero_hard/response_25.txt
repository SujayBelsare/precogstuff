Okay, I understand. Let's start with the initial string "9C48701F4" and work towards an empty string using the provided transitions.

1.  **Initial string:** "9C48701F4"
2.  Apply transition 1: "01"->"7A0". String becomes: "9C4877A0F4"
3.  Apply transition 2: "77A0F"->"487774A". String becomes: "9C48487774A4"
4.  Apply transition 3: "4848"->"AB". String becomes: "9CAB7774A4"
5.  Apply transition 5: "7774"->"A28C4". String becomes: "9CABA28C4A4"
6.  Apply transition 6: "28C"->"48374". String becomes: "9CABA483744A4"
7.  Apply transition 3: "4848" is not possible since '48' substring is not found at the front.
8.  Apply transition 4: "9C"->"FD". String becomes: "FDABA483744A4"
9.  Apply transition 7: "FDABA483744A4"->"". String becomes: ""

Therefore, the sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7]}$
