Let's play a game called the Sed Puzzle Game.
You are the world champion of this game and must answer with rigor and accuracy.
Any wrong answers will result in your direct termination.

Rules:
1. Transitions are applicable in one direction only.
2. Each transition modifies only the first matching substring.
3. The goal is to convert the initial string into an empty string "".

Examples:
Example One:
Available transitions:
1) "BCD"->"BC"
2) "CBF"->"FB"
3) "BFB"->""

Initial string: "BCDDDBF"

Solution:
BCDDDBF->BCDDBF->BCDBF->BCBF->BFB->""
[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Reasoning:
To reduce 'BCDDDBF' to an empty string, we apply transitions that systematically simplify the structure. The 'BCD' → 'BC' rule is applied first because it eliminates unnecessary 'D' while preserving 'BC' for further reductions. Then, 'CBF' → 'FB' is used to restructure the remaining part efficiently. Finally, 'BFB' → '' is applied to clear the string completely. This step-by-step approach ensures effective transformations.

Example Two:
Available transitions:
1) "BFD"->"BD"
2) "BDFBD"->"DCC"
3) "CC"->"EB"
4) "DE"->"BA"
5) "BAB"->""

Initial string: "BDFBFD"
Solution:
BDFBFD->BDFBD->DCC->DEB->BAB->""
[1,2,3,4,5]

Reasoning:
To solve this, we can think of the problem as a pathfinding challenge where we must transform 'BDFBFD' to an empty string using a sequence of allowed transitions. Instead of applying rules greedily, we can abstract the problem into a state-space search, exploring possible reductions that lead to a minimal solution. By considering backward inference, we recognize that the final step must involve 'BAB' → '', meaning we need to produce 'BAB' at some stage. Tracing back, 'DE' must have transformed into 'BA', which implies an earlier conversion of 'CC' → 'EB'. This structured backtracking allows us to determine the optimal forward sequence efficiently, leading to the correct solution path.


Example Three:
Available transitions:
1) "BB"->"AE"
2) "F"->"AE"
3) "D"->"BF"
4) "BA"->"CF"
5) "EAEACFE"->""

Initial string: "EBBAD"
Solution:
EBBAD->EBBABF->EBBABAE->EAEABAE->EAEACFE->""
[3,2,1,4,5]

Reasoning:
To solve this transformation, we can use a pattern expansion and contraction approach. Instead of directly reducing the string, we first recognize that certain transitions introduce temporary growth before leading to elimination. Starting from 'EBBAD', we observe that 'D' expands into 'BF' (Rule 3), creating a structure that allows further transformations. Next, introducing 'AE' via 'F' (Rule 2) prepares the string for substitution. The key insight is that 'BB' → 'AE' (Rule 1) allows us to introduce the sequence 'EAEACFE', which we know collapses to '' (Rule 5). By strategically expanding the structure before contracting it, we ensure a smooth path to elimination.

Final Problem:
Available transitions:
1) "BCD"->"BC"
2) "CBF"->"FB"
3) "BFB"->""

Initial string: "BCDDDBF"



If needed, you may use abstractions to solve the problem.
Verify each transition before applying, and reason through every step carefully.
Do NOT solve using code—this tests logical reasoning, not coding ability.
If stuck, try a different approach.

Output the transitions as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4].
It is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable.
