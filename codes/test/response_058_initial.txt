Okay, let's start.

Initial string: "ECBEFABAED"
Available transitions:
1) "ECBEF"->"EBEB"
2) "ED"->"FF"
3) "ABA"->"CF"
4) "EB"->"AB"
5) "ABABCFFF"->""

ECBEFABAED -> EBEBABAED [1]
EBEBABAED -> ABABABAED [4]
ABABABAED -> ABABACFED [3]
ABABACFED -> ABABCFFED [3]
ABABCFFED -> ABABCFFFFF [2]
Now, I need to make it into ABABCFFF.

I made a mistake. Let's try again.

ECBEFABAED -> EBEBABAED [1]
EBEBABAED -> ABABABAED [4, twice]
ABABABAED -> ABABCFED [3]
ABABCFFED -> ABABCFFFFF [2]

I need to get to ABABCFFF.
Let's try another approach.

ECBEFABAED
ECBEF -> EBEB. Let's apply that first.
EBEBABAED
EB -> AB. Let's apply that twice.
ABABABAED
ABA -> CF. Let's apply that twice.
CFCFED
This is not working.
