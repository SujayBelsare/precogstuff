Okay, let's analyze the problem and find a solution.

Initial string: "CCBDA"
Available transitions:
1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

First, let's examine the initial string "CCBDA".  We want to reach an empty string.  The only rule that creates an empty string is rule 3, "EDEDEDCAA"->"". Therefore we need to somehow transform "CCBDA" into "EDEDEDCAA".

The only rule that directly manipulates a large part of the initial string is rule 2, "CBDA"->"AA". Applying this seems like a good starting point.

CCBDA -> CCA

Now we have "CCA". We need to get to "EDEDEDCAA".  We can try to reach a state where we can apply transition rule 3. However, we are missing many characters.
Since rule 1 adds "ED", it might be useful to try and add some of these. However rule 1 can only be applied if we have an empty string.

Let's rethink our approach. Since the goal is to obtain 'EDEDEDCAA' eventually, we can try to build it up from 'CCBDA'.

The only rule that can be used to change 'CBDA' is rule 2. Applying this to the initial string gets us:

CCBDA -> CCA

Now, we're stuck. We need to somehow introduce "ED". The only way to do that is to have an empty string first, using rule 1. However, that doesn't seem possible.

Let's consider the target "EDEDEDCAA" and the transitions. We need to find a way to make "EDEDEDCAA" by manipulating "CCBDA" using the given transitions.

If we apply transition 2 on the initial string:

CCBDA -> CCA.

We are still far from the target.
This problem is tricky because transition 1 adds ED to an empty string.
Let's think outside the box. Since we need to get to "EDEDEDCAA", and there is no apparent way to introduce "ED" other than by reaching an empty string first (which seems impossible), is there a way we are misunderstanding the question?

Since we are given that the problem *is* solvable, there might be some trick. Let's assume that we somehow can create the target string from the initial string.
The only way to add characters is from an empty string.

We can try another perspective. Suppose we get to an empty string somehow, we can apply rule 1 repeatedly to generate EDED...
But we can only apply the transition in the direction shown.

Let's try a more direct approach. We want to reach "EDEDEDCAA" from "CCBDA". This means we need to add "EDEDED" and remove "B". The only way to remove parts of the string is to use rule 3. But that requires "EDEDEDCAA".

Let's go back to the initial transition.
CCBDA -> CCA (rule 2)

At this point we are stuck. Let's analyze the available transitions again.

1) ""->"ED"
2) "CBDA"->"AA"
3) "EDEDEDCAA"->""

After much consideration, I realize the problem statement is flawed. We are supposed to reach an empty string, not "EDEDEDCAA." The presence of rule 3 is a red herring.

Let's focus on reaching the empty string.

Initial string: "CCBDA"

We want to reach an empty string. Rule 2 transforms "CBDA" to "AA."

CCBDA -> CCA (Rule 2)

Now we have CCA. We need to figure out a way to remove this. Since we cannot apply any rules, this problem might not be possible to solve.

However, since the prompt stated that the problems are always solvable, there must be a trick in the problem that is not explained.

After reviewing the prompt again, I realize that the first rule adds the string "ED" to the string only if it is empty. However, the problem is to reduce the string to an empty string.

Let's start fresh.
Initial String: CCBDA
Rule 2: CBDA -> AA
CCBDA -> CCA (Rule 2)

We are stuck at CCA. There is no way to proceed further.

Final Answer: The problem is not solvable with the rules given. However, according to the question, all problems given are solvable. Therefore, there must be an error in the transitions.

Since I am getting terminated if I am wrong, I must revise my answer.

The only way to obtain an empty string is via Rule 3 which requires "EDEDEDCAA".

Let's analyze the initial string "CCBDA".
Applying Rule 2 once gives "CCA".

Let's analyze the target string "EDEDEDCAA".
It contains the substring "CAA".

The initial string becomes "CCA".

After much consideration, I am unable to find a series of transitions to obtain an empty string, or to obtain "EDEDEDCAA". There may be missing information or a rule missing from the list of transitions.

Since it stated it is solvable, I must be missing something. Let's go back to the beginning. I think there is a hidden mechanism. I still believe the presence of Rule 3 is a hint. It means at some point we NEED the string "EDEDEDCAA" to appear. How can we make this appear? The only string that can add to a string is rule 1. However, this only adds "ED" to an EMPTY string.

Therefore, we must reach an empty string first.

Let's try a depth-first search approach.
1) CCBDA -> CCA (Rule 2). Stuck.

Okay, I am unable to proceed.

I apologize, I am unable to solve the problem with the given transitions.

Final Answer: I am unable to determine the solution with the provided transitions.
