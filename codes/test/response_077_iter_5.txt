Okay, John Watson suggests working backward. The goal is to reach "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD61". Then apply rule 4 to obtain "".

Target: "9418FA7394B7FCD08"
Initial: "B7FCD61"

1. We need to transform "61" to "08". This can be done with rule 1. So, "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08" using rule 1.

Now we have "B7FCD08". We want to get to "9418FA7394B7FCD08".
We can add "94" at the beginning using rule 2.

2.  Apply rule 2: "" -> "94". So, "B7FCD08" -> "94B7FCD08".

Now we have "94B7FCD08".  We want "9418FA7394B7FCD08".  So we need to insert "18FA7394" after the first "94".
We know "9494" -> "18FA73" from rule 3. So we need to create "9494". We already have one "94".

3. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94". So, "94B7FCD08" -> "9494B7FCD08".

Now we have "9494B7FCD08". We can apply rule 3 to transform "9494" to "18FA73".

4. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73". So, "9494B7FCD08" -> "18FA73B7FCD08".

Now we have "18FA73B7FCD08". We want "9418FA7394B7FCD08". So we need to insert "94" before "18FA73".

5. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94". So, "18FA73B7FCD08" -> "9418FA73B7FCD08".

Now we have "9418FA73B7FCD08". We want "9418FA7394B7FCD08". So we need to insert "94" after "18FA73".

6. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94". So, "9418FA73B7FCD08" -> "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

Now we have "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

7. Apply rule 4: "9418FA7394B7FCD08" -> "".

The sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4]
