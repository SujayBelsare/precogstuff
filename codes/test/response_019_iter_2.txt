Okay, let's analyze this carefully. We want to get to "BAFDAF". John Watson is hinting that the order of applying rules 1 and 3 is key. Rule 1 moves "DC" to "CD". Rule 3 transforms "E" to "AF".

Initial string: "DEDCE"

1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E"->"AF"
   "DEDCE" -> "DAFDCE"

2. Apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
   "DAFDCE" -> "DAFCDCE"

3. Apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
   "DAFCDCE" -> "DAFCDC E" (No change)

4. Apply rule 3 to the last E: "E"->"AF"
   "DAFCDCE" -> "DAFCDCFAF"

This isn't it. Let's try another order.

Initial string: "DEDCE"

1. Apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
   "DEDCE" -> No change because there is no DC.

Let's try a different approach. Let's think about how to create the "BAF" sequence.
We can get "AF" from "E". We need a "B" before that.
Rule 2 is "DEC"->"BE". So if we had "DEC", we could get "BE".

Initial string: "DEDCE"

1. Apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
   "DEDCE" -> No change because there is no DC

2. Apply rule 2: "DEC"->"BE"
   "DEDCE" -> "BECE"

3. Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E"->"AF"
   "BECE" -> "BAFCE"

4. Apply rule 3 to the last E: "E"->"AF"
   "BAFCE" -> "BAFCAF"

This is close. We need "BAFDAF".

Let's try this:
Initial string: "DEDCE"

1. Apply rule 3 to the last E: "E"->"AF"
   "DEDCE" -> "DEDCAF"

2. Apply rule 2: "DEC"->"BE"
   "DEDCAF" -> "BECAF"

3. Apply rule 3 to the E: "E"->"AF"
   "BECAF" -> "BAFCAF"

Still not right.

Okay, let's try this approach. We need to get "BAFDAF". Let's try to create "DEC" first.
Initial string: "DEDCE"

1. Apply rule 1: "DC"->"CD" (No change)
DEDCE

2. Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E"->"AF"
DAFDCE

3. Apply Rule 1: "DC"->"CD"
DAFCDCE

4. Apply rule 3 to the last E:
DAFCDCFAF

Ok, Let's go back.
Initial string: "DEDCE"
Apply rule 2: DEC -> BE
BECE
Apply rule 3 to first E: BAFCE
Apply rule 3 to last E: BAFCAF

Let's try something else,

Initial String: DEDCE
1. Rule 3 on second E: DEDCAF
2. Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
3. Rule 3 on the E: BAFCAF

Initial String: DEDCE
1. Rule 3 on second E: DEDCAF
2. Rule 1: No change
3. Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
4. Rule 3: BAFCAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Rule 3 on LAST E: DEDCAF
Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
Rule 3: BAFCAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECE
Rule 3 on first E: BAFCE
Rule 3 on second E: BAFCAF

Let's try one more time.

Initial String: DEDCE
Apply rule 3 to last E: DEDCAF
Apply rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
Apply rule 3 to first E: BAFCAF

Nope.

Let's go back to beginning.
Initial string: DEDCE
Apply rule 2: DEC -> BE
BECE
Apply rule 3 to first E: BAFCE
Apply rule 3 to last E: BAFCAF

Let's try applying Rule 3 to both E's first

Initial String: DEDCE
Rule 3 on both E's: DAFDCFAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Rule 3 on first E: DAFDCE
Rule 1: DAFCDCE
Rule 3 on last E: DAFCDCFAF

Okay, I'm starting over.

Initial String: DEDCE
Apply Rule 3 to the LAST E: DEDCAF
Apply Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
Apply Rule 3 to the remaining E: BAFCAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Apply Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECE
Apply Rule 3 to the first E: BAFCE
Apply Rule 3 to the last E: BAFCAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Apply Rule 3 to the first E: DAFDCE
Apply Rule 1: DAFCDCE
Apply Rule 3 to the last E: DAFCDCFAF

Initial String: DEDCE
Apply Rule 2: DEC -> BE : BECE
Apply Rule 3 to the first E: BAFCE
Apply Rule 3 to the last E: BAFCAF

That's still not it.

Let's try something completely different.

Initial string: DEDCE
Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECE
Rule 3 on first E: BAFCE
Rule 3 on last E: BAFCAF
Nope

DEDCE
Rule 3 on last E: DEDCAF
Rule 2: DEC -> BE: BECAF
Rule 3: BAFCAF
Nope

DEDCE
Rule 3 on first E: DAFDCE
Rule 1: DAFCDCE
Rule 3 on last E: DAFCDCFAF

Okay, let's analyze the target string "BAFDAF". We can get "AF" from "E". We can get "BE" from "DEC".
So somehow we need to transform the initial string into something that can become BAFDAF.

DEDCE
If we apply Rule 2 first:
BECE
Then Rule 3 on both E's:
BAFCAF

If we apply Rule 3 to the LAST E:
DEDCAF
Then Rule 2:
BECAF
Then Rule 3:
BAFCAF

If we apply Rule 3 to the FIRST E:
DAFDCE
Then Rule 1:
DAFCDCE
Then Rule 3:
DAFCDCFAF

Let's try this:
DEDCE
Rule 3 to the LAST E: DEDCAF
Rule 2: BECAF
Rule 3: BAFCAF
Nothing is working!

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on strategically using rule 1 to rearrange the string before applying other rules.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
