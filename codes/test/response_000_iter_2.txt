Okay, let's analyze the transitions again and the number of 'D's.

Initial string: "EDDAC"
Available transitions:
1) "EDDA"->"FF"
2) "C"->"CD"
3) "FFCDDD"->""

We want to reach "FFCDDD".
The initial string has one 'D' and one 'C'. We need two more 'D's and "FF" at the beginning.

"EDDAC"

1. Apply rule 2 (C -> CD): "EDDACD"
We now have two 'D's and one 'C'. We need one more 'D'.

2. Apply rule 2 (C -> CD): This is not possible since we already applied it.

"EDDAC"

If we apply rule 1 first: EDDA -> FF
"FFC"

Then apply rule 2: C -> CD
"FFCD"

We need two more D's.

"EDDAC"
1. Apply Rule 2: C -> CD.  "EDDACD"
2. Apply Rule 1: EDDA -> FF. "FFCD"

We need two more D's.

"EDDAC"
1. Apply Rule 1: EDDA -> FF. "FFC"
2. Apply Rule 2: C -> CD. "FFCD"

We need FFCDDD. We have FFCD.

"EDDAC"
1. Apply Rule 2: C -> CD. "EDDACD"
2. Apply Rule 1: EDDA -> FF. "FFCD"

We have "FFCD". We need two more Ds.

"EDDAC"
1. Apply Rule 2: C -> CD. "EDDACD"
2. Apply Rule 1: EDDA -> FF. "FFCD"

We are stuck.

Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
