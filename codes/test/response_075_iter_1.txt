Okay, let's work backward from the final transition (7) and map the states.
The final transition is "1A5B07E76F5"->"".
So, we need to transform "13CFE6D3349EC692" to "1A5B07E76F5".

Initial string: "13CFE6D3349EC692"
Target string: "1A5B07E76F5"

1. **Transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"**
"13CFE6D3349EC692" -> "1A5D3349EC692"
Now we have "1A5" at the beginning, which is good.

2. **Transition 5: "D3"->"B0"**
"1A5D3349EC692" -> "1A5B0349EC692"
Now we have "1A5B0".

3. We want "1A5B07E76F5", so we need to transform "349EC6" into "7E76F5".
Let's apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B0349EC692" -> "1A5B037EEC292"

This doesn't seem to be going in the right direction. Let's try something else.

Let's look at the target "7E76F5". We have transition 6: "EB"->"76". So, we want to create "EB" somewhere. Also, we have transition 4: "EC9"->"EB".

Going back to our initial string, we can see "EC692". So, we need to get "EC9" from "EC692". We also have "3349EC6" -> "37EEC2".

Let's try this:
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"

We need to transform "349EC692" to "7E76F5". We have the transition "3349EC6"->"37EEC2".
So we need to get "3349EC6" from "349EC692". This doesn't seem possible.

Let's think outside the box.
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"13CFE6D337EEC292"
Now we have "EEC292".
2. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D337EEC292"
3. Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B037EEC292"

Let's try starting with the end. We need "76F5" at the end. We can get "76" from "EB".
We can get "EB" from "EC9".
We need to create "EC9" at some point.

"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB". We don't have EC9.
5. Apply transition 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
6. Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
7. Apply transition 6: "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We need "1A5B07E76F5". We have "1A5B037EE76F5".
Let's think. We need to get "7E" from "37EE".

Let's try this approach:
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Transition 1: "3349EC6" -> "37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Transition 2: "292" -> "9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Transition 4: "EC9" -> "EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Transition 6: "EB" -> "76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We want "1A5B07E76F5".

Let's go back.
"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. 3CFE6 -> A5
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. D3 -> B0
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply 1: 3349EC6 -> 37EEC2
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: 292 -> 9F5
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: EC9 -> EB
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: EB -> 76
"1A5B037EE76F5"

"1A5B07E76F5" is the goal.

Let's start from the end.
We need to create the substring "1A5B07E76F5".
We can create "76" using "EB".
We can create "EB" using "EC9".

Let's try this:
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

The target is "1A5B07E76F5".
We currently have "1A5B037EE76F5".

This approach seems wrong.

Let's try to create "1A5B07E76F5" from the start.
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"

We need "7E76F5". We have "349EC692".
"3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"292"->"9F5"
"EC9"->"EB"
"EB"->"76"

Let's try this:
1. "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We want "1A5B07E76F5".

"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. 3CFE6 -> A5
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. D3 -> B0
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. 3349EC6 -> 37EEC2
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. 292 -> 9F5
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. EC9 -> EB
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. EB -> 76
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We are close! We have "1A5B037EE76F5" and we want "1A5B07E76F5". We need to turn "37EE" to "7E".

Let's think again.

"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. 3CFE6 -> A5
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. D3 -> B0
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. 3349EC6 -> 37EEC2
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. 292 -> 9F5
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. EC9 -> EB
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. EB -> 76
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We want to get rid of "3EE" and have "E". This is not possible using the given transitions.

Let's start with the last rule.
"1A5B07E76F5"

We have "13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6" -> "A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: "D3" -> "B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"

We need "7E76F5".

Let's try another order.
"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. Apply transition 1: "3349EC6" -> "37EEC2"
"13CFE6D337EEC292"
2. Apply transition 3: "3CFE6" -> "A5"
"1A5D337EEC292"
3. Apply transition 5: "D3" -> "B0"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply transition 2: "292" -> "9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply transition 4: "EC9" -> "EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply transition 6: "EB" -> "76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

Still, we can't remove the "3EE".

Let's try a different approach.

"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. Apply 3: "3CFE6" -> "A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply 5: "D3" -> "B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply 1: "3349EC6" -> "37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: "292" -> "9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: "EC9" -> "EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: "EB" -> "76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

If we apply the final transition (7), we need to get "1A5B07E76F5".
We have "1A5B037EE76F5".

This is not solvable. There must be an error.

Let me try again.
"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. Apply 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"
We need "1A5B07E76F5" and we have "1A5B037EE76F5".

Let me try a different approach.
