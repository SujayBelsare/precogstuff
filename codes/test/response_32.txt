Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We want to transform "DFBCE" into "".

Available transitions:
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""

The issue is that we cannot directly apply transition 2 because our initial string is "DFBCE", not "DDDDDDDDDFBCE". Also, transition 1 creates "DD", which doesn't seem immediately helpful.

However, notice that the target string in transition 2, namely "DDDDDDDDDFBCE" contains "DFBCE", our initial string. This suggests our strategy has to involve somehow creating a series of "DD"s and then prepending them to "DFBCE" so it matches the left hand side of transformation 2. We can only create the string "DD" with transition 1.

Since transition 1 changes "" to "DD", it has to be used *after* DFBCE has been reduced down to "". But the only transformation to get to "" is transition 2. So we can only use it if we get the source string to be "DDDDDDDDDFBCE".

The transitions are:
1) ""->"DD"
2) "DDDDDDDDDFBCE"->""

Initial string: "DFBCE"

We cannot directly apply transition 2. Transition 1 inserts DD *after* the string is empty, so it's not helpful here. It appears that the puzzle is unsolvable given the available transitions and the initial string. The only transition that can lead to the empty string is rule 2, but the initial string is not of the right form to use rule 2.

Let's review the problem statement and ensure I did not miss a rule or condition:
* Transitions are applicable in one direction only.
* Each transition modifies only the first matching substring.
* The goal is to convert the initial string into an empty string "".

I made an error in my logic. The string is "DFBCE". Since transition 1 adds "DD" at the end AFTER the string is empty, we should never call it. The only way to reach the empty string is using transition 2. However we can never make the initial string match the left hand side of transition 2. Thus, the problem is not solvable, which contradicts the problem statement that the puzzle is always solvable.

Therefore, there *must* be an implicit empty string that the transitions operate on, and insertion by rule 1 prepends "DD" to it rather than appends "DD" to it. Even still, rule 1 can only be applied if the string is empty.

The problem is unsolvable with the current transitions and initial string.

Final Answer: The problem is unsolvable.
