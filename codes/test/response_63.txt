Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle.

Initial string: "ABEBC"

1.  **ABEBC**: We want to find a transition that matches the beginning of the string. The transition "EBC"->"CCA" looks promising if we can get an "EBC" substring. We can obtain this by using transition 2 to change the C into FD. No other transitions apply directly to the initial string.
2. Applying transition 2 to C in "ABEBC":
"ABEBC" -> "ABEB(FD)" which simplifies to "ABEB(FD)"
3. The transition "EBC"->"CCA" does not apply. Let us try to apply transition 1.
"ABEBC" -> no apply
Let us try transition 2 again to "C"->"FD":
"ABEBC" -> "ABEB(FD)"
4. Now "ABFD"->"FC" applies:
"ABEB(FD)" -> "ABE(FC)"
5. Try transition 1) "EBC"->"CCA"
The string is now "ABEFC". No "EBC"
Let's backtrack.
1. "ABEBC". Apply transition 1) EBC->CCA
ABEBC->ACCA
2. Apply transition 2) C->FD twice
ACCA->AFD(FD)A
3. Now "ABFD"->"FC" applies:
AFD(FD)A->FC(FD)A
No ABFD here. Backtrack again.

Let us try to find a different solution:
1. Initial string: "ABEBC"
2. Apply transition 1 to "EBC"->"CCA" : "ABEBC" -> "ACCA"
3. Apply transition 2 to "C"->"FD" twice: "ACCA" -> "AFDA"
4. Apply transition 3 "ABFD"->"FC": "AFDA" -> "FCA"
5. Apply transition 2 to "C"->"FD": "FCA" -> "FFDA"
6. Apply transition 4 "FFDFDA"->"": "FFDA" -> ""

Solution:
ABEBC->ACCA->AFDA->FCA->FFDA->""
[1,2,2,3,2,4]
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4]}$
