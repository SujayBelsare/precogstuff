Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert "DBFACCE" to "".

Initial string: "DBFACCE"

Available transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

1. Applying transition 1 to "DBFACCE":
   "DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE"
   The transition used is [1]

2. To use rule 3, we need to introduce the "EBEBEB" sequence. Applying transition 2 is useless here.

3. So let's rethink. It seems we should aim to get "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" directly or through intermediate steps. We already have "DBBDCCE".

4. Hmm, transition 2 is ""->"EB". This transition alone cannot make the string shorter. Transition 3 reduces the entire string to "".
   Let's try to build the target string from the beginning. It seems impossible to get to "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".

5. Let's go back to step 1. The first transition gave us DBBDCCE. Notice that "DBBDCCE" is very close to "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".
It seems we need to add "EBEBEB" to the beginning. However rule 2 only adds EB to the end of empty strings. So our assumptions were false.

6. Let's review the question again. We must get to an empty string. We should instead try to destroy the current string.
   Available transitions:
   1) "FA"->"BD"
   2) ""->"EB"
   3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

7. If we apply rule 1 we have DBBDCCE. Then what ? We cannot apply rule 2, 3 or even rule 1 again.
   If we don't apply rule 1, we cannot use rule 3, either.
   Since there must be a solution, let's assume the answer is not trivial and we must use all rules.
   Maybe we should add some EB using rule 2, but it will make the string longer.

8. Let's rethink. We need "EBEBEBDBBDCCE". We have "DBFACCE". If we could turn FA into DBBDCCE, then we are done. That is wrong because FA to BD.
So we have DBFACCE -> DBBDCCE. Now we have DBBDCCE.
If we could turn DBBDCCE to EBEBEBDBBDCCE, we are done.

9. Since there are no other applicable rules given "DBFACCE", it means there is something we are missing.

10. Available transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""
Initial string: "DBFACCE"
DBFACCE -> DBBDCCE.

11. We should think backwards. We need "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".
So DBBDCCE must somehow be created to use rule 3.
We have "DBFACCE" to begin with.
We know we can turn "FA" to "BD".
So we have "DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE".

Now, we need to turn "DBBDCCE" into "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"
That means we have to add "EBEBEB" to the beginning of "DBBDCCE"
But that doesn't seem right...

12. The problem stated all questions are solvable. So there must be a way to construct this.
Let's re-examine rule 2: ""->"EB". That's no use at all. It makes the string longer.
Let's re-examine rule 1: "FA"->"BD".
Let's re-examine rule 3: "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

Maybe there is an approach we are missing.
DBFACCE -> DBBDCCE.
What is after that?

13. Ok, I think I got it. We just need to figure out the trick. Let's re-examine everything.
Available transitions:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB"
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

Initial string: "DBFACCE"
Goal: ""

"DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE"  (using transition 1)

We want to get the string "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" to apply rule 3.
Currently, we have "DBBDCCE". It seems impossible to get to "EBEBEBDBBDCCE".

Let's see if there is some hidden trick here. Maybe the problem is not what it seems.

14. I apologize, I'm unable to find the correct sequence of transitions.
