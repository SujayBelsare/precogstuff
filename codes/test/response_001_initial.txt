Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert "CADF" to "".

Available transitions:
1) "DBB"->"DF"
2) "CADF"->"ADF"
3) "A"->"AD"
4) "ADDDF"->""

Initial string: "CADF"

1. **CADF -> ADF**  (Apply rule 2)
Now the string is "ADF"

2. **A -> AD** (Apply rule 3)
Now the string is "ADDF"

3. **A -> AD** (Apply rule 3)
Now the string is "ADDDF"

4. **ADDDF -> ""** (Apply rule 4)
Now the string is ""

The solution is [2, 3, 3, 4].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 3, 3, 4]}$
