Okay, let's focus on creating "7E" instead of just "76". Transition 6, "EB"->"76", gives us "76", but we need "7E". Transition 1, "3349EC6"->"37EEC2", provides a "7" and an "EE". Let's try to arrange things such that "EE" is next to the "7".

"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. **Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"**
"1A5D3349EC692"

2. **Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"**
"1A5B0349EC692"

3. **Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"**
"1A5B037EEC292"

Now we have "37EEC2". We want "7E". Let's try to get rid of the "3".

4. **Apply transition 2: "292"->"9F5"**
"1A5B037EEC9F5"

5. **Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"**
"1A5B037EEBF5"

6. **Apply transition 6: "EB"->"76"**
"1A5B037EE76F5"

This gives us "1A5B037EE76F5", and we need "1A5B07E76F5". This isn't working. We have "3" in "37EE".

Let's rethink. We need "7E". Transition 1 gives us "37EEC2". We have "37EEC2". Let's try to isolate the "7E". We want "7E". If we can get "3" out of the way, then we have it.

"13CFE6D3349EC692"

1. **Apply transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"**
"13CFE6D337EEC292"

2. **Apply transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"**
"1A5D337EEC292"

3. **Apply transition 5: "D3"->"B0"**
"1A5B037EEC292"

4. **Apply transition 2: "292"->"9F5"**
"1A5B037EEC9F5"

5. **Apply transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"**
"1A5B037EEBF5"

6. **Apply transition 6: "EB"->"76"**
"1A5B037EE76F5"

This gives us "1A5B037EE76F5", and we want "1A5B07E76F5". Still wrong.

We have "13CFE6D3349EC692".
We need "1A5B07E76F5".

1. Apply transition 3: 3CFE6 -> A5
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Apply transition 5: D3 -> B0
"1A5B0349EC692"

We need to create 7. We can create 7 with transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"

"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Apply transition 1: 3349EC6 -> 37EEC2
"1A5B037EEC292"

We need "7E". From 37EEC2, we want 7E.

4. 292 -> 9F5
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. EC9 -> EB
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. EB -> 76
"1A5B037EE76F5"
We need "7E".

If we did

1. 3->A5:
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. 3349 -> 37 EEC2
A5D3
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply 1: 3349EC6 -> 37EEC2
"13CFE6D337EEC292"
2. Apply 3: 3CFE6 -> A5
"1A5D337EEC292"
3. Apply 5: D3 -> B0
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: 292 -> 9F5
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: EC9 -> EB
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: EB -> 76
"1A5B037EE76F5"

Still wrong. We need "7E".

"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Transition 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D3349EC692"
2. Transition 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B0349EC692"
3. Transition 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Transition 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Transition 4: "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Transition 6: "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"

We want "1A5B07E76F5".
Let's change the order
"13CFE6D3349EC692"
1. Apply 1: "3349EC6"->"37EEC2"
"13CFE6D337EEC292"
2. Apply 3: "3CFE6"->"A5"
"1A5D337EEC292"
3. Apply 5: "D3"->"B0"
"1A5B037EEC292"
4. Apply 2: "292"->"9F5"
"1A5B037EEC9F5"
5. Apply 4: "EC9"->"EB"
"1A5B037EEBF5"
6. Apply 6: "EB"->"76"
"1A5B037EE76F5"
We still get "1A5B037EE76F5".

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7]}$
