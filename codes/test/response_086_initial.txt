Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. The initial string is "B9F504266C66" and the target is "". The available transitions are:

1) "04266"->"3BF"
2) ""->"66"
3) "B9"->"00"
4) "66"->"A3"
5) "66A36600F53BFC66"->""

Let's try to apply the transitions step by step.

1. Apply rule 3: "B9"->"00". The string becomes "00F504266C66"
2. Apply rule 1: "04266"->"3BF". The string becomes "00F53BFC66"
Now we need to introduce "66A36600F53BFC66" to use rule 5. We currently have "00F53BFC66".

Let's try to work backwards from rule 5. We need to get to "66A36600F53BFC66". We have "00F53BFC66". We need to introduce "66A366" at the beginning. We can make "66" using rule 2, but it introduces it at the beginning, which is not what we want.
Let's look at the string "B9F504266C66" again.

1. Apply rule 1: "04266"->"3BF". The string becomes "B9F53BFC66"
2. Apply rule 3: "B9"->"00". The string becomes "00F53BFC66"
We are back to the same point.

Let's try another strategy. The final string needs to contain "66A36600F53BFC66".
We have "B9F504266C66".

1. Apply rule 4: "66"->"A3". The string becomes "B9F504266CA3"
This doesn't seem to lead anywhere useful.

Let's go back to the original string "B9F504266C66". We want to get "66A36600F53BFC66".

1. Apply rule 3: "B9"->"00". The string becomes "00F504266C66"
2. Apply rule 1: "04266"->"3BF". The string becomes "00F53BFC66"
3. Apply rule 4: "66"->"A3". The string becomes "00F53BFCA3"

This isn't going to get us there. Let's think outside the box. We need "66A36600F53BFC66". We have "B9F504266C66".

1. Apply rule 1: "04266"->"3BF". String becomes "B9F53BFC66"
2. Apply rule 3: "B9"->"00". String becomes "00F53BFC66"
3. Apply rule 4: "66"->"A3". String becomes "00F53BFCA3"

Let's try to get "66A36600F53BFC66" from "00F53BFCA3". It seems impossible.

Let's go back to the beginning. "B9F504266C66".

1. Apply rule 3: "B9" -> "00". String becomes "00F504266C66"
2. Apply rule 1: "04266" -> "3BF". String becomes "00F53BFC66"
3. Apply rule 4: "66" -> "A3". String becomes "00F53BFCA3"

I still don't see a way to get "66A36600F53BFC66".

Let's examine the target string "66A36600F53BFC66". It contains "66", "A3", "00", "F5", "3BF", "C66".

Let's start from the end.
"B9F504266C66"
Let's apply rule 4 to the last 66.
"B9F504266CA3"
Now apply rule 1.
"B9F53BFCA3"
Then rule 3.
"00F53BFCA3"

I am stuck.
