Okay, let's analyze the problem again, focusing on creating the "8EF730B" sequence. We need to strategically apply the transitions to form this specific string. We know that the final step must be rule 7: "8EF730B"->""

Initial string: "777338E9"

1. Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]
This gives us "EF", which is part of our target.

2. Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"EF7338E9" -> "EEF338E9" [5]
Now we have "EEF".

3. Apply rule 6: "E"->"8E"
"EEF338E9" -> "8EEF338E9" [6]
Now we have "8EEF".

4. Apply rule 1: "9"->"AE3"
"8EEF338E9" -> "8EEF338EAE3" [1]
Now we have "8EEF338EAE3".

5. Apply rule 2: "338EA"->"3B"
"8EEF338EAE3" -> "8EEF3BE3" [2]
Now we have "8EEF3BE3".

6. Apply rule 3: "BE3"->"DA"
"8EEF3BE3" -> "8EEF3DA" [3]
Now we have "8EEF3DA".

7. Apply rule 4: "DA"->"0B"
"8EEF3DA" -> "8EEF30B" [4]
Now we have "8EEF30B".

We are close! We need to transform one of the 'E's into nothing.
This is not possible. Let's go back to step 3.

"777338E9"
1. Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]
This gives us "EF", which is part of our target.

2. Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"EF7338E9" -> "EEF338E9" [5]
Now we have "EEF".

3. Apply rule 1: "9"->"AE3"
"EEF338E9" -> "EEF338EAE3" [1]
Now we have "EEF338EAE3".

4. Apply rule 2: "338EA"->"3B"
"EEF338EAE3" -> "EEF3BE3" [2]
Now we have "EEF3BE3".

5. Apply rule 3: "BE3"->"DA"
"EEF3BE3" -> "EEF3DA" [3]
Now we have "EEF3DA".

6. Apply rule 4: "DA"->"0B"
"EEF3DA" -> "EEF30B" [4]
Now we have "EEF30B".

7. Apply rule 6: "E"->"8E"
"EEF30B" -> "8EEF30B"[6]

This is not helping.

Let's start with the last rule.
7) "8EF730B"->""

We need "8EF730B"

So, we can apply rules in different order

"777338E9"
1. Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]
2. Apply rule 1: "9"->"AE3"
"EF7338E9" -> "EF7338EAE3" [1]
3. Apply rule 2: "338EA"->"3B"
"EF7338EAE3" -> "EF73BE3" [2]
4. Apply rule 3: "BE3"->"DA"
"EF73BE3" -> "EF73DA" [3]
5. Apply rule 4: "DA"->"0B"
"EF73DA" -> "EF730B" [4]
6. Apply rule 6: "E"->"8E"
"EF730B" -> "8EF730B" [6]
7. Apply rule 7: "8EF730B"->""
"8EF730B" -> "" [7]

The transitions are: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
