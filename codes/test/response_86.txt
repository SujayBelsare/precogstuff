Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the solution.

Initial String: "9C3FEC0F9"

Transitions:
1) "C3FEC0F9"->"86C5"
2) "9"->"65"
3) "586"->"5B"
4) "5"->"69"
5) "C5"->"B6"
6) "6665BB6"->""

Step 1: Apply rule 2 to the first '9'.
"9C3FEC0F9" -> "65C3FEC0F9"  [2]

Step 2: Apply rule 1
"65C3FEC0F9" -> "6586C5" [1]

Step 3: Apply rule 5
"6586C5" -> "6586B6" [5]

Step 4: Apply rule 4 to the first '5'.
"6586B6" -> "66986B6" [4]

Step 5: Apply rule 4 to the '9'.
"66986B6" -> "666586B6" [4]

Step 6: Apply rule 3
"666586B6" -> "66655BB6" [3]

Step 7: Apply rule 4 to the '5'.
"66655BB6" -> "666695BB6" [4]

Step 8: Apply rule 4 to the '9'.
"666695BB6" -> "6666655BB6" [4]

Step 9: Apply rule 6.
"6666655BB6" -> No match.

Try a different approach.

Initial String: "9C3FEC0F9"

Transitions:
1) "C3FEC0F9"->"86C5"
2) "9"->"65"
3) "586"->"5B"
4) "5"->"69"
5) "C5"->"B6"
6) "6665BB6"->""

Step 1: Apply rule 2 to the first '9'.
"9C3FEC0F9" -> "65C3FEC0F9" [2]

Step 2: Apply rule 1.
"65C3FEC0F9" -> "6586C5" [1]

Step 3: Apply rule 5.
"6586C5" -> "6586B6" [5]

Step 4: Apply rule 3.
"6586B6" -> No Match

Let's try again.

Initial String: "9C3FEC0F9"
Step 1: 2
"65C3FEC0F9"
Step 2: 1
"6586C5"
Step 3: 4
"66986C5"
Step 4: 5
"66986B6"
Step 5: 4
"666586B6"
Step 6: 3
"66655BB6"
Step 7: 6
""
[2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 6]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 6]}$
