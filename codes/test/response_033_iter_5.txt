Okay, John Watson is hinting at simplification. I need to look for opportunities to reduce the string, even if it doesn't directly lead to the final "BFBBC" form.

Initial string: BBBCAFBDEC

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA (Rule 1)

Now we have BBBFBCAFFBCA. Let's analyze the rules again:

1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

We have "BBBFBCAFFBCA". We want to get to "BFBBC".

I see the simplification!

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA (1)
2. BBBFBCAFFBCA -> BFEBDCAFFBCA (2)  (BBFFB -> FEBD, where BBFFB is a substring of BBBFBCAFFBCA)

Now we have BFEBDCAFFBCA.

We want to isolate EBDCA

3. BFEBDCAFFBCA -> BFFFEAFFBCA (3) (EBDCA -> FFE)

Now we have BFFFEAFFBCA.

4. BFFFEAFFBCA -> BFBBCAFFBCA (4) (FFE -> BBC)

Now we have BFBBCAFFBCA.

We are close, we want to isolate BFBBC

5. BFBBCAFFBCA -> "" (This is wrong and cant be done)

Okay, so I was wrong. Let me rethink.

We have BBBCAFBDEC.

The goal is to get to BFBBC.

Let me call John Watson again.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on the placement of the BFBBC. Think about what rules can help you create or isolate that pattern.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
