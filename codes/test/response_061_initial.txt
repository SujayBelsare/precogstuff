Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "CBAEF", and the goal is to transform it into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "F"->"DE"
2) "DE"->"AC"
3) "CBAEAC"->"BE"
4) ""->"AC"
5) "ACACBE"->""

Let's try a sequence of transformations:

1. Apply transition 1: "CBAEF" -> "CBADE"
2. Apply transition 2: "CBADE" -> "CBAAC"

Now, let's think about the target "ACACBE". We need "BE" at the end. We can obtain this by applying rule 3.

Let's go back to "CBAEF".
1. Apply transition 1: "CBAEF" -> "CBADE"
2. Apply transition 2: "CBADE" -> "CBAAC"

We want "ACACBE". Let's try to create "ACAC".

Let's consider the reverse of the transitions, working backwards from the empty string.
5) "ACACBE" -> ""
3) "CBAEAC" -> "BE"
2) "DE" -> "AC"
1) "F" -> "DE"

Initial string: "CBAEF"

1. Apply transition 1: "CBAEF" -> "CBADE"
2. Apply transition 2: "CBADE" -> "CBAAC"

We need to get to "ACACBE".
If we can transform "CBAAC" to "ACACBE", we are done.
Let's try another approach.

1. Apply transition 1: "CBAEF" -> "CBADE"
2. Apply transition 2: "CBADE" -> "CBAAC"

We want to create "ACACBE". We have "CBAAC".

Let's try to get "CBAEAC" to apply transition 3. We need to create an EAC at the end.

1. "CBAEF" -> "CBADE" (1)
2. "CBADE" -> "CBAAC" (2)
3.  Now, we need to create an "EAC".  We can't directly create it. But we can create "DE" using transition 1.

Let's try to work backwards.
"" <- "ACACBE" (5)
"BE" <- "CBAEAC" (3)
We want "CBAEF" -> ""

Let's try this:
1. "CBAEF" -> "CBADE" (1)
2. "CBADE" -> "CBAAC" (2)

We need to somehow introduce a 'BE' using rule 3. For that we need "CBAEAC". We have "CBAAC".

1. "CBAEF" -> "CBADE" (1)
2. "CBADE" -> "CBAAC" (2)
3.  We are at "CBAAC". We can't directly get to "CBAEAC".

Let's try a different approach.
1. "CBAEF" -> "CBADE" (1)
2. "CBADE" -> "CBAAC" (2)
We are at "CBAAC". We need "ACACBE" to apply transition 5.

1. "CBAEF" -> "CBADE" (1)
2. "CBADE" -> "CBAAC" (2)
3.  We are stuck.
