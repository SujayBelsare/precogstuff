Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "BCECE" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

Let's try applying the transitions and see where it leads us.

"BCECE"
Applying rule 1: "ECE"->"EA"
"BCECE" -> "BCEA"

Now we have "BCEA". We need to introduce a large number of "BB" to trigger rule 3. Rule 2 allows us to insert "BB" at the beginning of the string if it is empty. This is not helpful here. We need to transform "BCEA" into "BBBBBBBCEA".

Let's think backwards from the target "BBBBBBBCEA". We need to somehow add six "B"s to the beginning of "BCEA". The only way to introduce "B"s is through rule 2. But rule 2 only applies to the empty string.

Let's think about the string "BCECE" again. We want to reach "BBBBBBBCEA".

"BCECE" -> "BCEA" (rule 1)

We need to add 6 "B"s. Let's analyze the available transitions again.
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

We can apply rule 1 to get "BCEA". But there are no rules to add "B"s to the beginning of the string.
Let's try to find a sequence of rules that leads to the empty string.
We can't directly apply rule 3 now.
Let's see, is there any other option available?

Let's rethink the problem. We need to somehow get "BBBBBBBCEA". We already have "BCEA" after applying rule 1. We need 6 more "B"s. The rule 2 can only be applied to an empty string.

Let's check for any mistakes. Initial string: "BCECE"
Transitions:
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

"BCECE" -> "BCEA" (rule 1)
Now, we need 6 more "B"s. There's no way to add them.
