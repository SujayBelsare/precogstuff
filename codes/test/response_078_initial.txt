Okay, let's analyze the problem.

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"
Available transitions:
1) "8"->"81"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

The goal is to transform "8BB86503B248" into "".

The only way to get rid of everything is to use transition 3.
Transition 3 requires the string to be "DC811111BB86503B248".

We start with "8BB86503B248".
We need to introduce "DC" at the beginning and change the "8" to "811111".

First, we apply rule 2 to get "DC8BB86503B248".
Then we apply rule 1 four times to the first "8" to obtain "811111".

"8BB86503B248" -> "DC8BB86503B248" [2]
"DC8BB86503B248" -> "DC81BB86503B248" [1]
"DC81BB86503B248" -> "DC811BB86503B248" [1]
"DC811BB86503B248" -> "DC8111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC8111BB86503B248" -> "DC81111BB86503B248" [1]

We want "DC811111BB86503B248".
We currently have "DC81111BB86503B248". We need two more "1"s.

"DC81111BB86503B248" -> "DC811111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC811111BB86503B248" -> "DC8111111BB86503B248" [1]

Now we have "DC8111111BB86503B248" and we want "DC811111BB86503B248". This approach doesn't work. Let's try something else.

The target string is "DC811111BB86503B248".
The initial string is "8BB86503B248".

We need to add "DC" in the beginning and transform "8" to "811111".

Let's start by adding "DC" at the beginning.
"8BB86503B248" -> "DC8BB86503B248" [2]

Now we need to change the "8" to "811111".
"DC8BB86503B248" -> "DC81BB86503B248" [1]
"DC81BB86503B248" -> "DC811BB86503B248" [1]
"DC811BB86503B248" -> "DC8111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC8111BB86503B248" -> "DC81111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC81111BB86503B248" -> "DC811111BB86503B248" [1]

Now we have "DC811111BB86503B248".
We can now apply rule 3.

"DC811111BB86503B248" -> "" [3]

Therefore, the solution is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3].

```
[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]
```
