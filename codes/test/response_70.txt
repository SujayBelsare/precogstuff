Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"
Available transitions:
1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

1. Apply transition 1 to "DCADC":
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCCCebcc"
[1]

2. Apply transition 2 to the first "C":
"BFEFCCCebcc" -> "BFEFBCBDebcc"
[1, 2]

3. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBCBDebcc" -> "BFEFBDBDdebbd"
[1, 2, 2]

4. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBDdebbd" -> "BFEFBDBDBDEBD"
[1, 2, 2, 2]

5. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBDBDEBD" -> "BFEFBDBDBDEBBd"
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

6. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBDBDEBBd" -> "BFEFBDBDBDEBBD"
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

7. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBDBDEBBD" -> "BFEFBDBDBDEBBD"
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

That isn't working. Let's try a different approach.

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"

1. Apply transition 1 to "DCADC":
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCCCEBCC"
[1]

2. Apply transition 2 to the first "C":
"BFEFCCCEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBCEBCC"
[1, 2]

3. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBBDEBCC"
[1, 2, 2]

4. Apply transition 3 to "BDEBCC":
"BFEFBDBBDEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBEEDCCB"
[1, 2, 2, 3]

5. Apply transition 2 to the first "C":
"BFEFBDBEEDCCB" -> "BFEFBDBEEDBCDB"
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2]

6. Apply transition 2 to the next "C":
"BFEFBDBEEDBCDB" -> "BFEFBDBEEDBDBDB"
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2]

That isn't working either. Let's try another approach.

Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"

1. Apply transition 1 to "DCADC":
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCCCEBCC"
[1]

2. Apply transition 2 to the first "C":
"BFEFCCCEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBCEBCC"
[1, 2]

3. Apply transition 2 to the second "C":
"BFEFBDBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBBDEBCC"
[1, 2, 2]

4. Apply transition 3 to "BDEBCC":
"BFEFBDBBDEBCC" -> "BFEFBDBEEDCCB"
[1, 2, 2, 3]

Now we have: "BFEFBDBEEDCCB". Notice "BFEFBDBEEDCCB" is part of transition 4!

5. Apply transition 4 to "BFEFBDBEEDCCB":
"BFEFBDBEEDCCB" -> ""
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]}$
