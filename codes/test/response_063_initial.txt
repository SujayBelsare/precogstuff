Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "BAFFFDFC", and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "FFDF"->"ADE"
2) "AD"->"AF"
3) "AF"->"BE"
4) "BBE"->"EDE"
5) "EDEBEEC"->""

Let's try applying the transitions and see where it leads.

"BAFFFDFC"

We see "FFDF" in the string, so we can use transition 1:
BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC

Now we see "AD" so we can use transition 2:
BAADEC -> BAAFEC

Now we see "AF" so we can use transition 3:
BAAFEC -> BABEEC

Now we see "BBE" so we can use transition 4:
BABEEC -> EDEEC

Now we look for ways to create "EDEBEEC". We have "EDEEC".
We can try to create B somewhere. Looking at the transitions, AF -> BE and AD -> AF.
Going back to "BAFFFDFC", is there a better first step? Let's try to use transitions 2 and 3 to make "BE".

Starting again with "BAFFFDFC".
We want to create "EDEBEEC". We can use rule 5 to reduce "EDEBEEC" to "".

"BAFFFDFC" -> "BAADEC" [1]
"BAADEC" -> "BAAFEC" [2]
"BAAFEC" -> "BABEEC" [3]
"BABEEC" -> "EDEEC" [4]
Now we need a B in the middle of "EDEEC" to get "EDEBEEC".

Let's try going backwards.
We need "EDEBEEC". Before that, we need "BBE" to become "EDE". So we need "BBE" somewhere.
To get "BBE", we can use "AF"->"BE". So we need "AF". To get "AF", we can use "AD"->"AF". So we need "AD". To get "AD", we can use "FFDF"->"ADE".
So let's try this sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4.

"BAFFFDFC" -> "BAADEC" [1]
"BAADEC" -> "BAAFEC" [2]
"BAAFEC" -> "BABEEC" [3]
"BABEEC" -> "EDEEC" [4]

We need a "B" between "EDE" and "EC".
Let's see if we can introduce an "FFDF" somewhere to get "ADE".
Let's backtrack and see if we missed anything.

"BAFFFDFC"
If we apply rule 1 first: "BAADEC"
If we apply rule 2 first: No AD.
If we apply rule 3 first: No AF.
If we apply rule 4 first: No BBE.

Let's analyze the target string "EDEBEEC".
We need to create "EDEBEEC" somehow.
We can get "EDE" from "BBE". "BBE" comes from "AF". "AF" comes from "AD". "AD" comes from "FFDF".

Let's try another approach. Start with the end in mind. We need "EDEBEEC". How can we get that?
We need "EDE", "B", "EEC".
We can get "EDE" from "BBE".
So, if we have "BBEBEEC", we can transform it to "EDEBEEC".
How to get "BBEBEEC"?

Let's try this:
BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
BABEEC -> EDEEC [4]
We want to insert a "B" between the two "E"s.
Let's go back a few steps.

BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]

We have BABEEC. We want BBEBEEC. If we can get another BBE.

If we go back to BAFFFDFC, we can apply 1 to get BAADEC.
Then 2 to get BAAFEC. Then 3 to get BABEEC. Then 4 to get EDEEC.
Then apply rule 5: EDEBEEC -> ""

Let's try this again from scratch.

BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
BABEEC -> EDEEC [4]

We are stuck at EDEEC. We need EDEBEEC.
I think there is a mistake somewhere.
