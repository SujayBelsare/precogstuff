Okay, based on John Watson's feedback, the key is to create "CAFBDEC". Let's start with the initial string "BBBCAFBDEC". We already have "CAFBDEC", so we can apply rule 1 directly.

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

Now we have "BBBFBCAFFBCA". We want to get rid of the stuff before "CAFBDEC" or create another "CAFBDEC". Let's analyze the transitions again.
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Let's try another approach. To arrive at "", we need "BFBBC". So we need to make that somehow.
The string is "BBBCAFBDEC".

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
   "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

2. Apply transition 2 (BBFFB -> FEBD) on "BBBFB":
   "BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BFEBDCAFFBCA"

Now we have "BFEBDCAFFBCA". Let's apply transition 3 (EBDCA -> FFE):
"BFEBDCAFFBCA" -> "BFFFEAFFBCA"

Now apply transition 4 (FFE -> BBC):
"BFFFEAFFBCA" -> "BFBBCAFFBCA"

This isn't right. Let's go back.

"BBBCAFBDEC"

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

What if we apply transition 2 to the last "BBFFB"?
"BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BBBFBCAFEEBDCA". This does not seem right.

Let's go back to "BBBCAFBDEC".

We want to get "BFBBC" at the beginning to use rule 5.

Let's try to make "BBFFB" using "CAFBDEC" -> "FFBCA".
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

Then, "BBFFB" -> "FEBD".

"BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BFEBDCAFFBCA"

Then EBDCA -> FFE.

"BFEBDCAFFBCA" -> "BFFFEAFFBCA"

Then FFE -> BBC.

"BFFFEAFFBCA" -> "BFBBCAFFBCA".

This is not getting us closer to BFBBC.

Let's go back to "BBBCAFBDEC".

Let's try a different approach. We have "BBB" at the beginning. We want to get "BFBBC".

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

2. Apply transition 2 (BBFFB -> FEBD) on the "BBBFB":
"BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BFEBDCAFFBCA"

3. Apply transition 3 (EBDCA -> FFE) on the "EBDCA":
"BFEBDCAFFBCA" -> "BFFFEAFFBCA"

4. Apply transition 4 (FFE -> BBC) on the "FFE":
"BFFFEAFFBCA" -> "BFBBCAFFBCA"

We still don't have "BFBBC". It seems we are going in circles.

Let's re-think.

"BBBCAFBDEC"
We need to create BFBBC.
Apply rule 1: BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA
Apply rule 2: BBBFBCAFFBCA -> BFEBDCAFFBCA
Apply rule 3: BFEBDCAFFBCA -> BFFFEAFFBCA
Apply rule 4: BFFFEAFFBCA -> BFBBCAFFBCA

Let's try another path.

BBBCAFBDEC
-> BBBFBCAFFBCA (rule 1)
We want to create "BFBBC"

Let's start with the end in mind.
BFBBC -> "" (rule 5)
FFE -> BBC (rule 4)
EBDCA -> FFE (rule 3)
BBFFB -> FEBD (rule 2)
CAFBDEC -> FFBCA (rule 1)

BBBCAFBDEC

Let's try to create EBDCA using rule 1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA. Now let's try to somehow form EBDCA.

BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA
BBBFB -> FEBD

-> BFEBDCAFFBCA
EBDCA -> FFE

-> BFFFEAFFBCA
FFE -> BBC

-> BFBBCAFFBCA

This is incorrect.

Let's try another path.
"BBBCAFBDEC"
We want "BFBBC".

If we can get "FFBCA" at the beginning then maybe we can use rule 2.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider the possibility of applying rule 1 multiple times. Could creating multiple "FFBCA" substrings be beneficial?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
