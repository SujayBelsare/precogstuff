Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully.

Initial string: "DBADACDA"
Available transitions:
1) "D"->"DE"
2) "DA"->"FD"
3) "DEEEBAFDCFD"->""

The goal is to reach an empty string. The only way to get rid of characters completely is by using transition 3: "DEEEBAFDCFD"->""
Therefore, we need to transform "DBADACDA" into "DEEEBAFDCFD".

Let's try applying the rules to see what happens:
DBADACDA -> Applying rule 1 to the first D: DEBADACDA
DEBADACDA -> Applying rule 2 to DA: DEFBDACDA
DEFBDACDA -> Applying rule 1 to D: DEEFBDACDA
DEEFBDACDA -> Applying rule 1 to D: DEEEFBDACDA
Now we have "DEEEFBDACDA". We need to get to "DEEEBAFDCFD".

Let's try a different approach. We want to get "DEEEBAFDCFD".
We have "DBADACDA".

DBADACDA -> DEBADACDA (rule 1)
DEBADACDA -> DEFBDACDA (rule 2)

Let's try applying rule 1 multiple times at the beginning.
DBADACDA -> DEBADACDA (1)
DEBADACDA -> DEEBADACDA (1)
DEEBADACDA -> DEEEBADACDA (1)
DEEEBADACDA -> We need to get "DEEEBAFDCFD" from here.
DEEEBADACDA -> DEEEBAFDA (2)
DEEEBAFDA -> DEEEBAFDE (1)
DEEEBAFDE -> DEEEBAFDEE (1)

This path does not seem promising. Let's try again.
DBADACDA -> DEBADACDA (1)
DEBADACDA -> DEFBDACDA (2)
DEFBDACDA -> DEEFBDACDA (1)
DEEFBDACDA -> DEEEFBDACDA (1)

Let's try to work backward from the desired string "DEEEBAFDCFD".
We need to create this from "DBADACDA".

DBADACDA -> DEBADACDA (1)
DEBADACDA -> DEFBDACDA (2)
DEFBDACDA -> DEEFBDACDA (1)
DEEFBDACDA -> DEEEFBDACDA (1)
DEEEFBDACDA -> DEEEBA?DCFD

We need to get rid of the F and the D.

DBADACDA -> DEBADACDA (1)
DEBADACDA -> DEFBDACDA (2)
DEFBDACDA -> DEEFBDACDA (1)
DEEFBDACDA -> DEEEFBDACDA (1)
DEEEFBDACDA -> DEEEBADCDA (Apply 2 on FD)
DEEEBADCDA -> DEEEBAFDCDA (Apply 2 on DA)
DEEEBAFDCDA -> DEEEBAFDCFD (Apply 1 on D)
DEEEBAFDCFD -> DEEEBAFDCFDE (Apply 1 on D)

This seems wrong.

Let's try starting with rule 2:
DBADACDA -> DFDBDCDA
