Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "FFDAADCEDAEEF" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "FFDAADCE"->"AAFECEC"
2) "EC"->"CB"
3) "F"->"EC"
4) ""->"FA"
5) "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF"->""

Initial string: "FFDAADCEDAEEF"

Let's trace the initial string and see if any of the transitions can be applied directly.
- "FFDAADCE" is present in the initial string, so we can apply transition 1.

FFDAADCEDAEEF -> AAFECECDAEEF [1]

Now we have "AAFECECDAEEF". Let's see if we can apply any transitions.
- We have "EC" in the string, so transition 2 can be applied.

AAFECECDAEEF -> AAFECBCDAEEF [2]

Now we have "AAFECBCDAEEF".
- We have "F" in the string, so transition 3 can be applied.

AAFECBCDAEEF -> AAECBCBCDAEEF [3]

Now we have "AAECBCBCDAEEF".
- We have "EC" in the string, so transition 2 can be applied.

AAECBCBCDAEEF -> AACBCBCBCDAEEF [2]

Now we have "AACBCBCBCDAEEF".
- We have no direct transitions that apply. This looks like a dead end.

Let's try a different approach. Let's see if we can find a path to transition 5, which leads to the empty string. The target string for transition 5 is "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".

Initial string: "FFDAADCEDAEEF"

1) "FFDAADCE"->"AAFECEC"
2) "EC"->"CB"
3) "F"->"EC"

FFDAADCEDAEEF -> AAFECECDAEEF [1]

Now we have "AAFECECDAEEF".
- We have "F" in the string, so transition 3 can be applied.
AAFECECDAEEF -> AAECBCECDAEEF [3]

Now we have "AAECBCECDAEEF".
- We have "EC" in the string, so transition 2 can be applied.
AAECBCECDAEEF -> AACBCECDAEEF [2]

Now we have "AACBCECDAEEF".
- We have "EC" in the string, so transition 2 can be applied.
AACBCECDAEEF -> AACBCBCDAEEF [2]

Now we have "AACBCBCDAEEF".
- No direct transitions can be applied.

Let's backtrack. We need to get to "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".
Initial string: "FFDAADCEDAEEF"

Apply transition 1:
FFDAADCEDAEEF -> AAFECECDAEEF [1]

Apply transition 3 to the F:
AAFECECDAEEF -> AAECBCECDAEEF [3]

Apply transition 2 to the EC:
AAECBCECDAEEF -> AACBCECDAEEF [2]

Apply transition 2 to the EC:
AACBCECDAEEF -> AACBCBCDAEEF [2]

This doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

Let's try another approach.
We want "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF" from "FFDAADCEDAEEF".

Let's apply transition 3 to the F:
FFDAADCEDAEEF -> EC DADCEDAEEF [3]
This is incorrect, F is not at the start

FFDAADCEDAEEF
Apply transition 1
AAFECECDAEEF [1]
Apply transition 3 to F
AAECBCECDAEEF [3]
Apply transition 2
AACBCECDAEEF [2]
Apply transition 2
AACBCBCDAEEF [2]

Let's try something else. "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF"
We have 'EC' frequently, let's try to create it.

FFDAADCEDAEEF
Apply transition 3 to F:
EC FDAADCEDAEEF [3] incorrect, F has to be at the start.
Try another F.

I'm stuck.
