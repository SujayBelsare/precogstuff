Okay, let's focus on how to use the "1" and the "3" characters to create the "EE3" sequence, and ultimately, "A534C64E".

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1: "3E"->"94")**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2: "4DC5"->"91")**
3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3: "99"->"334C6")**
4. **334C61 -> 334C64E (Rule 6: "1"->"4E")**

We have "334C64E". We want "A534C64E". "A5" comes from "EE3".

Let's try to manipulate the "3" at the beginning.
We don't have any rules to directly modify "3".

We need "EE3". We have a "3" at the beginning. How can we get "EE" before the "3"?
Rule 4: ""->"EE" only works on an empty string.

The problem is we never have the ability to inject "EE" into the middle of the string.

I am still stuck.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're very close! You've identified that you need "EE3" to get "A5". Focus on the string "334C64E" that you are able to generate. Can you use another rule on it so that you are one step closer to having the "EE3" substring?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I have "334C64E". I need "EE3" to get "A5".

Let's examine the rules again.
1) "3E"->"94"
2) "4DC5"->"91"
3) "99"->"334C6"
4) ""->"EE"
5) "EE3"->"A5"
6) "1"->"4E"
7) "A534C64E"->""

I have "334C64E". Is there a rule I haven't considered?

We have two "3"s. Can we turn the second "3" into "EE"?

I am still stuck.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
There seems to be a misunderstanding of how to apply Rule 3. Rule 3 "99"->"334C6" replaces "99" with "334C6". Think about how you can get "99" again.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I see. I need to create "99" again.

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1: "3E"->"94")**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2: "4DC5"->"91")**
3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3: "99"->"334C6")**
4. **334C61 -> 334C64E (Rule 6: "1"->"4E")**

Now we have "334C64E". I need to create "99".

Let's analyze again. I need "A534C64E".
A5 is from EE3.
So I need EE3.
I have "334C64E".

I am stuck again.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're on the right track. After you get "334C64E," can you make use of Rule 1 to get "94" again?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Explain each and every step with full detail.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I have "334C64E". The hint is to use Rule 1 to get "94" again.

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1)**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2)**
3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3)**
4. **334C61 -> 334C64E (Rule 6)**

I have "334C64E". The hint is to use Rule 1. But Rule 1 is "3E"->"94". I don't have "3E".

Wait! I have "334C64E". If I can turn one of the "3"s into "9", then I can use Rule 3 again.
I need to create "99".
I need to create "3E".

I have "334C64E".

I am still unable to solve this.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on the 'E' at the end of "334C64E". Can you use the 'E' to create "3E" and then use Rule 1?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.

Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I have "334C64E". The hint is to use the 'E' to create "3E". But I don't have a "3" next to the "E".

I have "334C64E".

How can I move the "E" next to the "3"? I can't.

I'm going to list all possible transformations again:

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1)**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2)**
3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3)**
4. **334C61 -> 334C64E (Rule 6)**

I have "334C64E".

I still cannot see it.

Is there a number I can turn into an 'E'? Yes! Rule 6: "1"->"4E".

But I don't have a "1". I *used* to have a "1"!

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1)**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2)**
3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3)**

I have "334C61". Now I can't use rule 2 anymore.

Let's try again:

1. **3EDC5 -> 94DC5 (Rule 1)**
2. **94DC5 -> 991 (Rule 2)**

I have "991". Now apply rule 3:

3. **991 -> 334C61 (Rule 3)**

I have "334C61". Now apply rule 6.

4. **334C61 -> 334C64E (Rule 6)**

I have "334C64E". Now what?

I need to make EE3 somehow.

I am still stuck.

Rule 1 is "3E"->"94". I need "3E".

I can't directly move characters.

What if I could change the "4" to a "3"?
