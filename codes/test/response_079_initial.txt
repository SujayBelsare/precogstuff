Okay, let's start.

Initial string: "54B9E8"
Available transitions:
1) "E8"->"CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C"
3) "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
4) "DC"->"E1"
5) "B2C1E"->"7FEF71"
6) "547FEF"->"C065"
7) "C0657116"->""

First, let's apply rule 1: "E8"->"CD"
"54B9E8" -> "54B9CD"

Now, apply rule 2: "CD"->"6D7C"
"54B9CD" -> "54B96D7C"

Next, apply rule 3: "96D7C"->"2C1DC6"
"54B96D7C" -> "54B2C1DC6"

Apply rule 4: "DC"->"E1"
"54B2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1E16"

Apply rule 5: "B2C1E"->"7FEF71"
"54B2C1E16" -> "547FEF716"

Apply rule 6: "547FEF"->"C065"
"547FEF716" -> "C065716"

Now, we need to get a '1' after '71' to apply rule 7. Let's review the previous steps and see if we missed something.

Initial string: "54B9E8"
1) "E8"->"CD"  -> "54B9CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"
3) "96D7C"->"2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1DC6"
4) "DC"->"E1" -> "54B2C1E16"
5) "B2C1E"->"7FEF71" -> "547FEF716"
6) "547FEF"->"C065" -> "C065716"

We need to get "C0657116" to ""
We have "C065716".

Let's go back to "54B2C1E16". If we didn't apply rule 5, then what else could we do?
From "54B2C1E16", can we get to "C0657116"? No, this is not looking promising.

Let's try another approach. Suppose we don't apply rule 3 right away.

"54B9E8"
1) "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"
Now, what else can we do? Nothing. We must apply rule 3.

"54B9E8"
1) "E8"->"CD" -> "54B9CD"
2) "CD"->"6D7C" -> "54B96D7C"
3) "96D7C"->"2C1DC6" -> "54B2C1DC6"
4) "DC"->"E1" -> "54B2C1E16"
5) "B2C1E"->"7FEF71" -> "547FEF716"
6) "547FEF"->"C065" -> "C065716"

Still stuck.
