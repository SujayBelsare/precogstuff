Okay, let's tackle this Sed Puzzle. The initial string is "DBFACCE" and the goal is to reduce it to "".

The available transitions are:
1) "FA"->"BD"
2) ""->"EB" (This is a tricky one, adding "EB" to the beginning of the string!)
3) "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"->""

Let's try to reason this out. The target string "EBEBEBDBBDCCE" is quite long and specific. We need to somehow construct that string from "DBFACCE". The "FA"->"BD" transition might be useful in manipulating the middle section of our initial string.

"DBFACCE"

Let's apply transition 1: "FA"->"BD"
"DBFACCE" -> "DBBDCCE"

Now we have "DBBDCCE". This looks like it's getting closer to the target string, which has "DBBDCCE" in it. We are missing the "EBEBEB" part.

Let's think about the transition 2. Since the left side of transition 2 is empty, this means that transition 2 adds "EB" to the beginning of the string. Applying it repeatedly can give us "EBEBEB...".

Okay, here's a strategy. Apply rule 2 three times to get the "EBEBEB" part.
"DBBDCCE" -> "EBDCCD"
"EBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBDBBDCCE"
"EBEBDBBDCCE" -> "EBEBEBDBBDCCE"

Now we have the target string!
"EBEBEBDBBDCCE" -> ""

So, the complete solution is:
DBFACCE -> DBBDCCE [1]
DBBDCCE -> EBDBBDCCE [2]
EBDBBDCCE -> EBEBDBBDCCE [2]
EBEBDBBDCCE -> EBEBEBDBBDCCE [2]
EBEBEBDBBDCCE -> "" [3]

Therefore, the solution is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
