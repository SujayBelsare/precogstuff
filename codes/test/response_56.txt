Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "FEBACDD"
Available transitions:
1) "EBA"->"BAFBB"
2) "BC"->"EC"
3) "FBA"->"BA"
4) "FBE"->"BB"
5) "BABECDD"->""

1. **FEBACDD**: Let's look for matches. We find "EBA" inside "FEBACDD". Applying transition 1:
   FEBACDD -> FBAFBBCDD

2. **FBAFBBCDD**: We see "FBA". Apply transition 3:
   FBAFBBCDD -> BABBBCDD

3. **BABBBCDD**: Now we need to get to "BABECDD". There is no direct way to get from "BB" to "E". Let's go back to the first transition.
   
Let's analyze the initial string again.

Initial string: "FEBACDD"

1. **FEBACDD**: Let's look for matches. We find "EBA" inside "FEBACDD". Applying transition 1:
   FEBACDD -> FBAFBBCDD

2. **FBAFBBCDD**: We see "FBA". Apply transition 3:
   FBAFBBCDD -> BABBBCDD

3. **BABBBCDD**: Now we need to somehow get to "BABECDD". Let's try another approach. Let's consider the end string "BABECDD" and work backwards.
   The last possible operation has to be 5, so how do we get there.

Let's re-start from the initial string.

Initial string: "FEBACDD"

1. **FEBACDD**: Look for 'BC'. Found 'CD' and no 'BC'. Look for 'FBE', and 'FBA'.
   Apply transition 3 "FBA"->"BA".
   FEBACDD -> EBACDD

2. **EBACDD**: We see "EBA". Transition 1 "EBA"->"BAFBB".
    EBACDD -> BAFBBCDD

3. **BAFBBCDD**: Look for "FBA". Transition 3 "FBA"->"BA".
   BAFBBCDD -> BABBCDD

4. **BABBCDD**: transition 2 "BC"->"EC"
    BABBCDD -> BABECDD

5. **BABECDD**: transition 5 "BABECDD"->""
    BABECDD -> ""

Therefore, the solution is [3, 1, 3, 2, 5].

FINAL ANSWER: [3, 1, 3, 2, 5]
