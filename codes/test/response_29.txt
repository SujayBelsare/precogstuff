Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "FECEA"
Available transitions:
1) "FEC"->"BC"
2) "EA"->"FB"
3) "BCF"->"FD"
4) "FD"->"BA"
5) "BAB"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "FECEA".  "FEC" is at the beginning.
FECEA -> BCEA

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "BCEA". "EA" is present.
BCEA -> BCFB

Step 3: Apply transition 3 to "BCFB". "BCF" is at the beginning.
BCFB -> FDB

Step 4: Apply transition 4 to "FDB". "FD" is present.
FDB -> BAB

Step 5: Apply transition 5 to "BAB". "BAB" is present.
BAB -> ""

Solution: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
