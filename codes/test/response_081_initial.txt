Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "28381", and the goal is to reach an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "8381"->"595"
2) "59"->"BF"
3) "F5"->"12"
4) "2B"->"52A"
5) ""->"A3"
6) "A3A352A12"->""

Initial string: "28381"

Let's start by trying to apply the rules and see if we can get closer to the goal.
1. Applying rule 1 to "28381": "28381" -> "2595"
2. Applying rule 2 to "2595": "2595" -> "2BF5"
3. Applying rule 3 to "2BF5": "2BF5" -> "2B12"
4. Applying rule 4 to "2B12": "2B12" -> "52A12"

Now we have "52A12". We want to somehow create "A3A352A12". Let's try to get "A3" somewhere. Notice that rule 5 creates "A3" from "". This looks like we need to back track

Let's revisit our transitions.
"28381"
1) "8381"->"595"
2) "59"->"BF"
3) "F5"->"12"
4) "2B"->"52A"
5) ""->"A3"
6) "A3A352A12"->""

Looking at the target string "A3A352A12", we need to get "52A12" somehow.
If we can get "2B12", then we can use rule 4.
To get "2B12", we need "2BF5".
To get "2BF5", we need "2595".
To get "2595", we need "28381".

So, let's try to get another "A3". Since the only way to get "A3" is from "", we need to eliminate the string we have so far. This looks impossible.

Let's start again and try another approach.

"28381"
1) "8381"->"595"
2) "59"->"BF"
3) "F5"->"12"
4) "2B"->"52A"
5) ""->"A3"
6) "A3A352A12"->""

"28381" -> "2595" (rule 1)
"2595" -> "2BF5" (rule 2)
"2BF5" -> "52A12" (rule 4 on "2B", then rule 3 "F5"->"12")

If we could get "A3A3" at the beginning of the string, we would be in business.

Let's start by trying to manipulate the string to get the substring "8381" again so we can use rule 1 again. It doesn't look possible.

Let's try to work backwards from "A3A352A12"
We need to get "2B" from "52A", which isn't possible.

Let's try a different approach. Since we need to make the string equal to "A3A352A12", let's try to create "A3A3" first. We can create "A3" using rule 5. However, we can only apply rule 5 to an empty string.

It seems that we need to find a way to get "28381" to turn into an empty string through some series of operations.

"28381"
1) "8381"->"595"
2) "59"->"BF"
3) "F5"->"12"
4) "2B"->"52A"
5) ""->"A3"
6) "A3A352A12"->""

"28381" -> "2595" (rule 1)
"2595" -> "2BF5" (rule 2)
"2BF5" -> "2B12" (rule 3)
"2B12" -> "52A12" (rule 4)

We have "52A12". Now we need "A3A3". We are stuck
