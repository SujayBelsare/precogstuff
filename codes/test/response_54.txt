Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert "FBEEDAF" to "".

Initial string: "FBEEDAF"

Available transitions:
1) "DAF"->"DBC"
2) "EED"->"CA"
3) "BCA"->"CBAB"
4) "CBABBC"->"BCA"
5) "FCBAB"->""

1. Apply transition 1 to "DAF":
"FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC"

2.  We need to get "FCBAB" to use transition 5. Let's focus on the "EED" substring and use transition 2.
"FBEEDBC" -> "FBCABC"

3. Apply transition 3 to "BCA":
"FBCABC" -> "FCBABBC"

4. Apply transition 4 to "CBABBC":
"FCBABBC" -> "FBCABC"

5. Apply transition 3 to "BCA" again:
"FBCABC" -> "FCBABBC"

6. Apply transition 4 to "CBABBC"
"FCBABBC" -> "FBCABC"

We seem to be stuck in a loop. Let's try a different approach. Start by targeting EED with transition 2.

1. Apply transition 2 to "EED":
"FBEEDAF" -> "FBCAF"

Now, we want to create FCBAB.

Let's try to make "BCA" using transition 1, so we need DAF.

Starting from "FBCAF", how do we make DAF? We can't, so transition 2 first was wrong.

Let's go back to our first sequence:
1. "FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC" (Transition 1)
2. "FBEEDBC" -> "FBCABC" (Transition 2. Incorrect)

Instead of Transition 2, let's aim to get rid of EED. We can't. We need the F to combine with other things. So, our first transition of 1 ("DAF"->"DBC") must be correct.

1. "FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC"
From here, let's try transition 3, trying to build towards CBAB.

2. There is no BCA. So, let's use transition 2 to get CA.
"FBEEDBC" -> "FBCAABC"

We want FCBAB, and we have FBCA.
3. Apply transition 3 to "BCA"
"FBCAABC" -> "FCBABABC"

Not getting closer. Let's try again from step 1. Maybe we shouldn't have aimed for DAF at the beginning.

Let's re-examine "FBEEDAF". Let's try to get "FCBAB" first.

We need F, C, B, A, B.
If we use transition 1: "DAF"->"DBC", we get "FBEEDBC".
If we use transition 2: "EED"->"CA", we get "FBCAF".

Now we want to transition to "FCBAB" and then use transition 5 to clear it.

Let's go from "FBCAF". We can't get to "FCBAB" from here.

Okay, let's go back to the initial string, "FBEEDAF".
1. "FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC" (Transition 1)

Now, we have "FBEEDBC". We need to get "FCBAB".

Let's try transition 2 ("EED"->"CA")
"FBEEDBC" -> "FBCAABC"

Now we have "FBCAABC". Apply transition 3 ("BCA"->"CBAB"):
"FBCAABC" -> "FCBABABC"
Still not working.

Let's look at "FBEEDAF" again. Maybe we need to apply transition 1 twice, but it can only be applied once. We want "FCBAB". Let's start from the end. We need BAB.

Consider the transitions in reverse.
5) "FCBAB"->""
4) "CBABBC"->"BCA"
3) "BCA"->"CBAB"
2) "EED"->"CA"
1) "DAF"->"DBC"

"FBEEDAF". Apply 2.
1. "FBEEDAF" -> "FBCAF"

We need BAB.

Let's go back to basics. Can we even reach "FCBAB"?
"FBEEDAF"
Applying 1: "FBEEDBC"
Applying 2: "FBCAF"

From FBCAF, can we reach FCBAB? No.

Let's try to find a different path.

"FBEEDAF".
Apply 1) "DAF"->"DBC": "FBEEDBC"

Now we need BCA to transform into CBAB. We can get CA using transition 2:
2) "EED"->"CA": "FBEEDBC" -> "FBCAABC"

Now we have FBCAABC. Let's apply 3) "BCA"->"CBAB":
"FBCAABC" -> "FCBABABC"
Apply 5) to get rid of FCBAB:
"FCBABABC" -> "ABC"

We need to somehow turn ABC into nothing. We are stuck.

Let's go back to FBEEDAF.
We need to form FCBAB.

Let's reconsider FBEEDBC. Apply 3: No.
Apply 2: FBCAABC
Apply 3: FCBABABC.
Apply 5: ABC.

FBEEDAF.
Transition 1: FBEEDBC

Transition 2: FBCAABC

Transition 3: FCBABABC

Let's analyze ABC. This is a dead end.

FBEEDAF
FBEEDBC

Can we use BCA to get towards FCBAB?
Let's try working backward. To use 5, we need FCBAB. How to make it?

FBEEDAF -> applying transition 1.
FBEEDBC.

Apply transition 2: FBCAABC

We have tried all combinations. It appears there may be an error. I'm unable to get it to the empty string.

Let me try a different strategy. I will start by applying transition 1 and see if I can find any path.

1) "FBEEDAF" -> "FBEEDBC"
2) "FBEEDBC" -> "FBCAABC"
3) "FBCAABC" -> "FCBABABC"
4) "FCBABABC" -> "ABC"

This is the wrong approach. I apologize, but after extensive exploration, I'm unable to find the correct sequence of transitions. There might be an error in the problem statement, or I am missing something fundamental. I cannot risk giving an incorrect answer.
