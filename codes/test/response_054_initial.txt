Let's analyze the initial string "CCCBDF" and the available transitions to find a path to an empty string.

The transitions are:
1) "CCBDF"->"ADBAEA"
2) "DB"->"ADAD"
3) "A"->"DD"
4) "AD"->"EFF"
5) ""->"CB"
6) "CBCDDEFFADAEA"->""

Starting with "CCCBDF", we can apply transition 1:

"CCCBDF" -> "ADBAEAC"

Now we have "ADBAEAC". We need to get to "CBCDDEFFADAEA". Let's try applying rule 3 to expand all 'A's into 'DD's

"ADBAEAC" -> "DDBDDDEDDC"

That doesn't seem to be getting us closer. Let's go back to "ADBAEAC" and try a different approach. Let's examine what we need to create. We need "CBCDDEFFADAEA". We have "ADBAEAC".
Let's try to create "EFF" from "AD".

"ADBAEAC" -> "EFFBAEAC"

Now we have "EFFBAEAC". We want to create "CBCDDEFFADAEA". We have "EFFBAEAC". This doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

Let's rethink. We have the following transitions
1) "CCBDF"->"ADBAEA"
2) "DB"->"ADAD"
3) "A"->"DD"
4) "AD"->"EFF"
5) ""->"CB"
6) "CBCDDEFFADAEA"->""

Initial string: "CCCBDF"

Let's apply the first transition:
"CCCBDF" -> "ADBAEA"

Now we have "ADBAEA". We need to transform this into "CBCDDEFFADAEA".
Let's try expanding the A's.
"ADBAEA" -> "EFFBAEEFF"

Let's focus on the final transition "CBCDDEFFADAEA"->""
We need to create this string.
We have "ADBAEA".

Let's try applying rule 3 to all A's:
"ADBAEA" -> "DDBDDBDDEEDD"

That's getting us nowhere.

Let's look at rule 4: "AD"->"EFF".

"ADBAEA" -> "EFFBAEA"
Now we need to create "CBCDDEFFADAEA" from "EFFBAEA".

Let's try rule 3: "A"->"DD"

"EFFBAEA" -> "EFFBDDEDD"

Still nowhere. Let's go back.

"ADBAEA"

Let's apply rule 3 to the first A.

"ADBAEA" -> "DDBBAEA"

No.

Let's think outside the box.
We have "CCCBDF".
We want "CBCDDEFFADAEA".
We apply "CCBDF"->"ADBAEA".

"CCCBDF" -> "ADBAEA"

Now, we have "ADBAEA". We need to get to "CBCDDEFFADAEA".
Let's apply rule 3 to every A.
"ADBAEA" -> "DDBDDBDDEEDD"

That's not right.
