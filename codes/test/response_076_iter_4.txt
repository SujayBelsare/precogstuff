Okay, John Watson's suggestion of mapping the game states to track the transformations is helpful. Let's try a different approach, focusing on building the target string for transition 4, `"0707076ED2C2F7E"`, from our initial string `"27B39FE"` using the available transitions.

Initial String: "27B39FE"

1. **Transition 1:** `"" -> "07"`. This transition allows us to introduce "07" anywhere. Let's hold off on using it for now and see if we can manipulate the existing string first.

2. **Transition 2:** `"0727B3" -> "6C57"`. We need "0727B3" as a substring. Our current string is "27B39FE". Applying transition 1 gives us "07" somewhere. Let's say we apply it at the beginning. Then we have "0727B39FE". Applying transition 2 on "0727B3" results in "6C579FE". So the string is now "6C579FE".

3. **Transition 3:** `"C579F" -> "ED2C2F7"`. We have "6C579FE". We see "C579F" as a substring. Applying transition 3, we replace "C579F" with "ED2C2F7". So the string becomes "6ED2C2F7E".

Now the string is "6ED2C2F7E". We are trying to get `"0707076ED2C2F7E"`. We are very close. We just need to prepend "070707".

4. **Transition 1:** `"" -> "07"`. We apply transition 1 three times. First application: "076ED2C2F7E". Second application: "07076ED2C2F7E". Third Application: "0707076ED2C2F7E".

5. **Transition 4:** `"0707076ED2C2F7E" -> ""`. The current string is now `"0707076ED2C2F7E"`. Applying transition 4, we obtain "".

So the sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4]
