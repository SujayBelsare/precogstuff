Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem. The initial string is "CBBEC" and the available transitions are:

1) "BEC"->"CD"
2) "BC"->"BB"
3) "CBB"->"EEF"
4) "FD"->"ED"
5) "EEED"->""

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **CBBEC**  Applying transition 1 to "BEC" gives us:
2. **CBBCD**  Applying transition 2 to "BC" gives us:
3. **CBBBD**  Applying transition 3 to "CBB" gives us:
4. **EEFD**  Applying transition 4 to "FD" gives us:
5. **EEED**  Applying transition 5 to "EEED" gives us:
6. **""**

Therefore, the solution is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}$
