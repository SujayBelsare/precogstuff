Okay, I will try to use AD->AF->BE to create a B between EDE and EEC.

1) FFDF -> ADE
2) AD -> AF
3) AF -> BE
4) BBE -> EDE
5) EDEBEEC -> ""

Initial string: "BAFFFDFC"

1. BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
2. BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
3. BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
4. BABEEC -> EDEEC [4]

Now we have EDEEC. We need to insert B between EDE and EEC.
We need to create an AF, which comes from AD.

BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
BABEEC -> EDEEC [4]

Now we want EDEBEEC.

Let's try this:
BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
Instead of applying rule 4, let's go back to the original.

We want to insert a B.
AD -> AF -> BE.

1. BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
2. BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
3. BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
4. Apply rule 4: EDEEC

Now we need to insert a B.

BAFFFDFC

1. BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
2. BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
3. BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]

Now we have BABEEC.

Let's try a different path.

BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]

We have BAADEC.

Then BAAFEC [2]
Then BABEEC [3]
Then EDEEC [4]
Then nothing.

BAFFFDFC -> BAADEC [1]
BAADEC -> BAAFEC [2]
BAAFEC -> BABEEC [3]
BABEEC -> EDEEC [4]

Now we are at EDEEC. We need to insert B.

I am stuck again.

I give up.
