Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully.
Initial string: "CADF"
Available transitions:
1) "DBB"->"DF"
2) "CADF"->"ADF"
3) "A"->"AD"
4) "ADDDF"->""

We start with "CADF".

1. The most obvious transition is rule 2: "CADF"->"ADF". This gives us "ADF".  Our sequence is [2].

2. Now we have "ADF". We need to get to "ADDDF" to use rule 4.  Let's use rule 3: "A"->"AD". Applying this to "ADF" yields "ADDF". Our sequence is now [2, 3].

3. We now have "ADDF". Let's use rule 3 again: "A"->"AD". Applying to "ADDF" gives us "ADDDF". Our sequence is now [2, 3, 3].

4. Now we have "ADDDF". We can use rule 4: "ADDDF"->"". This yields "". Our sequence becomes [2, 3, 3, 4].

Therefore, the solution is [2, 3, 3, 4].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 3, 3, 4]}$
