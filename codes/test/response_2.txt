Okay, let's analyze the given problem carefully.

Initial string: "CADF"
Available transitions:
1) "DBB"->"DF"
2) "CADF"->"ADF"
3) "A"->"AD"
4) "ADDDF"->""

Goal: Empty string ""

Here's the thought process to solve this:

1. We start with "CADF".
2. Notice that transition 2 "CADF"->"ADF" can directly reduce the string to "ADF".
3. From "ADF", the transition 3 expands "A"->"AD" makes the string "ADDF".
4. Then, expand "A"->"AD" again makes the string "ADDDF"
5. Finally we can apply the transition 4 "ADDDF"->"" to get an empty string

Solution:

CADF->ADF->ADDF->ADDDF->""
[2, 3, 3, 4]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 3, 3, 4]}$
