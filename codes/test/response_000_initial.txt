Okay, let's analyze the problem.

Initial string: "EDDAC"
Available transitions:
1) "EDDA"->"FF"
2) "C"->"CD"
3) "FFCDDD"->""

We want to reach an empty string. The only transition that leads to an empty string is rule 3: "FFCDDD"->""

So, we need to somehow transform "EDDAC" into "FFCDDD".

Let's try applying the rules sequentially.
1. "EDDAC" -> Apply rule 1 (EDDA -> FF): "FFC"
2. "FFC" -> Apply rule 2 (C -> CD): "FFCD"

Now we have "FFCD". We want "FFCDDD". We can add the "DD" using rule 2. However, rule 2 only changes a 'C' to 'CD', and we don't have any more 'C's.

A different approach is needed. Let's try to reason backward.
We want to get to "FFCDDD". To get there, we can apply rules 1 and 2.
We have "EDDAC".
Apply rule 2 to "EDDAC": "EDDACD"
Apply rule 1 to "EDDACD" to get FF... doesn't work.

Let's revisit the initial attempt.
"EDDAC"
1. Apply rule 1: "EDDA"->"FF": "FFC"
2. Apply rule 2: "C"->"CD": "FFCD"
We need "FFCDDD".

Let's try applying rule 2 first.
"EDDAC"
1. Apply rule 2: "C"->"CD": "EDDACD"
Now we have "EDDACD". We want an "EDDA" substring. We have it.
2. Apply rule 1: "EDDA"->"FF": "FFCD"
Now we have "FFCD". We want "FFCDDD". We are missing "DD".
We can't use rule 2 anymore, because we don't have a "C".
