Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "9C3FEC0F9" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "C3FEC0F9"->"86C5"
2) "9"->"65"
3) "586"->"5B"
4) "5"->"69"
5) "C5"->"B6"
6) "6665BB6"->""

Let's start by applying the transitions one by one and see where it leads us.
1. Applying transition 2 to "9C3FEC0F9": "65C3FEC0F9"
2. Applying transition 1 to "65C3FEC0F9" is impossible.
3. Applying transition 4 to "65C3FEC0F9": "669C3FEC0F9"
4. Applying transition 1 to "669C3FEC0F9" is impossible.

Let's try a different approach. We need to somehow get "6665BB6" in our string.
Let's focus on the last character "9" and apply transition 2 on the initial string:
"9C3FEC0F9" -> "65C3FEC0F9"
Now we have "65" at the beginning.
Now apply transition 1 on the new initial string "65C3FEC0F9" is impossible since "C3FEC0F9" is not at the start of the string.
Now apply transition 4:
"65C3FEC0F9" -> "669C3FEC0F9"
Still cannot apply transition 1.

Let's try to apply transition 1 first:
"9C3FEC0F9" -> Applying transition 1 on "9C3FEC0F9" is impossible.
Let's apply transition 2 on "9C3FEC0F9":
"9C3FEC0F9" -> "65C3FEC0F9"
Next, let's apply transition 1 on "C3FEC0F9":
"9C3FEC0F9" is impossible.
Let's apply transition 2 on "9C3FEC0F9":
"65C3FEC0F9"

Let's try again. The initial string is "9C3FEC0F9".
1. Apply transition 2: "65C3FEC0F9"
2. Apply transition 1 (C3FEC0F9 -> 86C5): "6586C5"
3. Apply transition 4: "66986C5"
4. Apply transition 5: "66986B6"
We need to get "6665BB6". We are close.

Let's start over. The initial string is "9C3FEC0F9".
1. Apply transition 2: "65C3FEC0F9"
2. Apply transition 1: "6586C5"
3. Apply transition 4: "66986C5"
4. Apply transition 5: "66986B6"

Let's try another path.
1. Apply transition 2 to "9C3FEC0F9": "65C3FEC0F9"
2. Apply transition 1 to "65C3FEC0F9": "6586C5"
3. Apply transition 4 to "6586C5": "66986C5"
4. Apply transition 5 to "66986C5": "66986B6"

Let's try a different approach.
1. "9C3FEC0F9" -> "65C3FEC0F9" (Rule 2)
2. "65C3FEC0F9" -> "6586C5" (Rule 1)
3. "6586C5" -> "66986C5" (Rule 4)
4. "66986C5" -> "66986B6" (Rule 5)

We are not getting close to "6665BB6".
