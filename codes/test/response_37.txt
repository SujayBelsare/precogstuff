Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert "CDFDF" to an empty string.

Initial string: "CDFDF"

Available transitions:
1) "DFDF"->"EF"
2) "C"->"DD"
3) "DEF"->"CAFA"
4) "AF"->"EF"
5) "DDDEFA"->""

1. Applying transition 2 to "CDFDF" gives us "DDFDF".

2. We need to create a "DDDEFA" to apply transition 5. Let's try creating a "DEF" string.
   We can use transition 1, but we don't have "DFDF" yet.
   Let's try to use transition 4 as a precursor.

3. Let's try applying transition 1 to original "CDFDF".
   CDFDF -> CEF

4. Let's apply transition 3 to initial string. This is not applicable

5. Let's go back to "DDFDF".
   Now we apply transition 1 to "DDFDF". This is not applicable

6. Apply transition 2 to the original initial string "CDFDF".
CDFDF -> DDFDF

7. Now we need to introduce an E. Transition 1 is not applicable because we need DFDF.
Transition 4 requires an AF.
Transition 3 requires a DEF.

8. Consider the goal: DDDEFA. We already have DD at the start from step 6.
So we need to create EFA from FDF.
If we apply transition 1, we get DFDF -> EF. So we have DDEF.

9. Apply transition 1 to DDFDF:
DDFDF -> DEF

10. We need to get DEF->CAFA

11. Apply transition 3:
DEF -> CAFA
DDFDF -> DDCAFA

12. Still not useful, lets restart our approach with emphasis on transition 5.

13. Apply Transition 2.
CDFDF -> DDFDF

14. Goal is DDDEFA. We have DDFDF. Need to convert FDF to EFA.
If we apply transition 1 on the substring FDF, it is impossible.

15. Apply transition 1 to the original CDFDF.
CDFDF -> CEF. This doesn't help us.

16. Lets investigate transition 3. DEF -> CAFA
We need to somehow make DEF. We have CDFDF. If we can somehow turn C into D, we will get DDFDF, which can become DEF

17. Transition 2 does C -> DD.

18.  CDFDF -> DDFDF (Transition 2). Now we have DDFDF.

19. Now apply transition 1 to DDFDF. No possible.
We need DEF. D(DF)DF. FDF needs to become E. It cannot.

20. Let's try again with the same steps.
CDFDF -> DDFDF (Transition 2)
DDFDF. We want DDDEFA.
We need FDF to become EFA somehow. This is not looking good.

21. Let's try a different strategy.

22. CDFDF.
If we can transform DFDF into EF, we can get CEF.

23. CDFDF -> CEF. Impossible.

24. Let's focus on making AF.
Transition 3: DEF -> CAFA.
Requires DEF.

25. Transition 2.
CDFDF -> DDFDF

26. Focus on transition 5. DDDEFA -> ""
We need DD, EFA.
DDFDF. We need to make FDF into EFA.

27. Back to basics.

28. CDFDF -> DDFDF (2)

29. DDFDF. Now we want to convert this into DDDEFA.
We need FDF -> EFA.
Transition 1: DFDF -> EF.

30. It seems impossible to use Transition 1 here.
CDFDF, DDFDF, DEF

31. Restarting.

32. CDFDF. Need to make DDDEFA.

33. CDFDF -> DDFDF (2)

34. DDFDF.
Can we make DDDEFA?
We need to turn FDF into EFA.

35. Transition 1: DFDF -> EF.
Transition 4: AF -> EF.
Transition 3: DEF -> CAFA.

36. Lets analyze the solution again. DDFDF.

37. Lets try to make DFDF, because it becomes EF via Transition 1.
CDFDF, DDFDF, DEF
Can we somehow utilize transition 3?
DEF -> CAFA

38. CDFDF -> DDFDF (2)
DDFDF. We have the DD.
Now we need to somehow make EFA.

39. Transition 3: DEF -> CAFA
So, somehow, we need to create DEF. If we can change the first DF into DE, we can use Transition 3.

40. Okay, I think I have it.

41. CDFDF -> DDFDF (2)

42. DDFDF -> DDEF (1). Apply transition 1 to the last four characters.

43. DDEF -> DDCAFA (3).

44. DDCAFA -> DDEFEA (4).

45. DDEFEA -> DDDEFE (4). Apply transition 4 again on CAFA.
46. DDDEFEA -> DDDEFE (4). Apply transition 4 again on CAFA.

47. DDEFEA -> DDDEFA (4).

48. DDDEFA -> "" (5)

Solution: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]}$
