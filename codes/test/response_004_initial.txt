Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "BDACCEFEFBD" and we want to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions:

1) "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
2) "D"->"AE"
3) "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""

My initial thought is to try and create the long string in rule 3.

BDACCEFEFBD

Let's start by trying to create the "BAEACCAEAEBD" string.
We have "BDACCEFEFBD". We can see that we have "EFEFBD" which can be converted to "DDBD" by rule 1.

BDACCEFEFBD -> BDACCDDBD [1]

Now we have "BDACCDDBD". We need to get "BAEACCAEAEBD"

Let's apply rule 2.
Every "D" becomes "AE".
"BDACCDDBD" -> "BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE" [2, 2, 2, 2]

"BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE". This doesn't seem right. We want to get to "BAEACCAEAEBD".

Let's try a different approach. The final string has "BAE", "ACC", "AEAE", "BD".
Our initial string has "BD", "ACC", "EFEFBD".

BDACCEFEFBD -> BDACCDDBD [1]
BDACCDDBD -> BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE [2,2,2,2] -- No

Let's try working backward. We need "BAEACCAEAEBD". We have the transition:
3) "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""

We have "BDACCEFEFBD". We need to somehow get "BAEACCAEAEBD".

If we apply rule 1, we get "BDACCDDBD".

If we apply rule 2 to every D, we get "BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE".

If we apply rule 2 to only some Ds, it could work.

Let's look at what we have and what we need.
We have BDACCEFEFBD. We want BAEACCAEAEBD.

We need to turn the EFEFBD into AEBD.
EFEFBD -> DDBD [1]
So we have BDACCDDBD.
We need to turn CDDBD into EACC AE AE BD.

D -> AE [2]
BDACCDDBD -> BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE

That's not right.

Let's try to work backwards.
We need "BAEACCAEAEBD".
We have "BDACCEFEFBD".

We need to introduce an E after the B.
We need to turn CEFEFB into AEAE.
We need to turn D into D.
We need to insert an AE after the ACC.
We need to remove the EF.

It seems like the key is to use rule 1 to get DDBD.
BDACCEFEFBD -> BDACCDDBD [1]
Now we have "BDACCDDBD". We want to get "BAEACCAEAEBD".
We need to change CDDBD to EAEBD.
D -> AE [2]
So CDDBD -> CAEAEAE
We want CAEAEBD

Let's think step by step.
BDACCEFEFBD
BDACCDDBD [1]
BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE [2,2,2,2]

BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE -> BAEACCAEAEBD [3] Doesn't work

Let's look at the target string "BAEACCAEAEBD"
The initial string is "BDACCEFEFBD"
Applying rule 1 gives "BDACCDDBD".
Applying rule 2 gives "BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE" which is bad.

Let's try something else entirely.
What if we ONLY apply rule 2?
BDACCEFEFBD -> BAEACCAEFEFBAE [2] No, wrong.

Let's go back to the drawing board.

BDACCEFEFBD
We want to get BAEACCAEAEBD.

Rule 1: "EFEFBD"->"DDBD"
Rule 2: "D"->"AE"
Rule 3: "BAEACCAEAEBD"->""

BDACCEFEFBD -> BDACCDDBD [1]
BDACCDDBD -> BAEACCAEAEAEEBAE [2,2,2,2] We don't want this.

Instead, let's try to strategically apply Rule 2. We want BAE, so apply rule 2 to the first D.
"BDACCDDBD" -> "BAEACCDDBD" [2]
Now we want ACC, which we have.
We want AEAE, so we need to apply rule 2 twice to the DD.
"BAEACCDDBD" -> "BAEACCAEAEBD" [2,2]

So, the solution is [1, 2, 2, 2]

BDACCEFEFBD -> BDACCDDBD [1]
BDACCDDBD -> BAEACCDDBD [2]
BAEACCDDBD -> BAEACCAEAEBD [2,2]
BAEACCAEAEBD -> "" [3]

[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}$
