Let's analyze the initial string "ACDBC" and the available transitions to find a sequence that leads to an empty string.

Initial string: "ACDBC"

Transitions:
1) "CDB"->"DD"
2) "D"->"DA"
3) "ADAAADC"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "ACDBC".
ACDBC -> ADDDC
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to the first D in "ADDDC".
ADDDC -> ADAADC
[1, 2]

Step 3: Apply transition 2 to the first D in "ADAADC".
ADAADC -> ADAAADC
[1, 2, 2]

Step 4: Apply transition 3 to "ADAAADC".
ADAAADC -> ""
[1, 2, 2, 3]

Final Answer: [1, 2, 2, 3]
