Okay, let's start again from the initial string "CEEDDDCCBBEA". We want to transform this into an empty string using the given transitions.

Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"

Available transitions:
1) "EED"->"FDDAD"
2) "DADDDCCB"->"FACDEFDF"
3) "FD"->"BE"
4) "EF"->"FB"
5) "ACDEF"->"BF"
6) "CBFBBFDFBEA"->""

We need to find a sequence of transitions that eventually leads to rule 6, "CBFBBFDFBEA"->"", or some other path to the empty string.

Let's start by applying rule 1 to the "EED" substring.
CEEDDDCCBBEA -> CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]

Now we have "CFDDADDDDCCBBEA". We still want to get to "CBFBBFDFBEA". Let's try applying rule 2. We are looking for "DADDDCCB". We have "DADDDCCB" in the string.
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA -> CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]

Now we have "CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA". Let's see if we can apply rule 5: "ACDEF"->"BF". We find "ACDEF" in our string.
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA -> CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Now we have "CFFBFDFDCCBBEA". Let's apply rule 3 "FD"->"BE" twice.
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA -> CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
CFFBFBECCBBEA -> CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

Now we have "CFFBBECCBBEA".
We are still trying to get "CBFBBFDFBEA". It seems that this is not working.
Let's start over and try a different approach.

Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"

Available transitions:
1) "EED"->"FDDAD"
2) "DADDDCCB"->"FACDEFDF"
3) "FD"->"BE"
4) "EF"->"FB"
5) "ACDEF"->"BF"
6) "CBFBBFDFBEA"->""

Let's try to get "CBFBBFDFBEA" another way. We can apply rule 1:
CEEDDDCCBBEA -> CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]

Now we have "CFDDADDDDCCBBEA".
Let's try to isolate DADDDCCB.
We can rewrite the string as CF DADDDCCB BEA.
We can apply rule 2.
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA -> CFFACDEFDFBEA [2]

Now the string is "CFFACDEFDFBEA".
Let's try to eliminate "ACDEF".
CFFACDEFDFBEA -> CFFBFDFBEA [5]

The string is "CFFBFDFBEA". We want "CBFBBFDFBEA".
Let's use FD -> BE.
CFFBFDFBEA -> CFFBFBEBEA [3]

Let's try a different approach again.

Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"
Apply rule 1:
CEEDDDCCBBEA -> CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Apply rule 2:
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA -> CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Apply rule 5:
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA -> CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
Apply rule 3:
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA -> CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]

Let's go back to the initial string.
CEEDDDCCBBEA
Let's apply rule 1:
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]

Now, let's apply rule 2:
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]

Let's apply rule 5:
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's apply rule 3 twice:
CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

This doesn't seem right.
Let's restart.

CEEDDDCCBBEA
Let's apply rule 1.
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]

Let's apply rule 2.
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]

Let's apply rule 5.
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's apply rule 3.
CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]

Let's restart.

Let's try applying rule 1.
CEEDDDCCBBEA -> CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Let's apply rule 2.
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA -> CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Let's apply rule 5.
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA -> CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's try to get to rule 6 another way.
Maybe we need to create CBFBBFDFBEA.

Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"
Let's apply rule 1:
"CFDDADDDDCCBBEA" [1]
Let's apply rule 2:
"CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA" [2]
Let's apply rule 5:
"CFFBFDFDCCBBEA" [5]
Let's apply rule 3:
"CFFBFBECCBBEA" [3]

Let's try something else.
Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"
Apply rule 1:
CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Apply rule 2:
CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Apply rule 4: EF -> FB. We don't have this.
Apply rule 5: ACDEF -> BF
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's restart.
Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Apply Rule 1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Apply Rule 2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Apply Rule 5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
Apply Rule 3: CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
Apply Rule 3: CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

Let's restart.
Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Apply Rule 1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Apply Rule 2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Apply Rule 5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's try a different approach.
Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Apply Rule 1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Apply Rule 2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
Apply Rule 5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
Apply Rule 3: CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
Apply Rule 3: CFFBBECCBBEA [3]
Apply Rule 3:

Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA
2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA
5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA
3: CFFBFBECCBBEA
3: CFFBBECCBBEA

Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Let's try to make CBFBBFDFBEA

Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Rule 1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Now, let's try to create something close to DADDDCCB again.
Let's restart

Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
Let's try to apply FD -> BE
3: CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
3: CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

Initial String: CEEDDDCCBBEA
Rule 1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
Rule 2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]

At this point, we are at CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA.
We need CBFBBFDFBEA.
Let's apply rule 5 ACDEF -> BF
CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
Let's apply rule 3 FD -> BE twice.
CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

Initial String CEEDDDCCBBEA
1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
3: CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]

Let's restart.
Initial String CEEDDDCCBBEA
1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Let's restart
Initial String CEEDDDCCBBEA
1: CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]
2: CFFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]
5: CFFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]
3: CFFBFBECCBBEA [3]
3: CFFBBECCBBEA [3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 5, 3, 3]}$
