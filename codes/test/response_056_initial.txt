Let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "CEEAC", and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "AC"->"FC"
2) "EEFC"->"CE"
3) "C"->"CEAFBF"
4) "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE"->""

Let's try applying the transitions step by step.
"CEEAC"

1. Applying rule 1 (AC -> FC) to "CEEAC" results in "CEEFC".
2. Applying rule 2 (EEFC -> CE) to "CEEFC" results in "CCE".
3. Applying rule 3 (C -> CEAFBF) to "CCE" results in "CEAFBFCE".
4. Applying rule 3 (C -> CEAFBF) to "CEAFBFCE" results in "CEAFBFCEAFBF".
This is not leading to anywhere.

Let's try a different approach. We need to get to the string "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE". So, let's try to introduce more 'C's.
"CEEAC"
1. Apply rule 1 "AC"->"FC" to get "CEEFC"
2. Apply rule 2 "EEFC"->"CE" to get "CCE"
3. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFCE"
4. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFCEAFBF"
5. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBF"
Now we need CE at the end.
"CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBF"
We need to somehow put CE at the end.
We can try to replace C to CEAFBF again.
Let's look at the final string. "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBFCE". This has three "EAFBF"s.
Let's go back to "CEEAC"
"CEEAC"
1. Apply rule 1 "AC"->"FC" to get "CEEFC"
2. Apply rule 2 "EEFC"->"CE" to get "CCE"
3. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFCE"
4. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFCEAFBF"
5. Apply rule 3 "C"->"CEAFBF" to get "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBF"
Now we need "CE" at the end.

Let's try it again.

"CEEAC"
1. Apply rule 1: "AC"->"FC"  => "CEEFC"
2. Apply rule 2: "EEFC"->"CE" => "CCE"
3. Apply rule 3: "C"->"CEAFBF" => "CEAFBFCE"
4. Apply rule 3: "C"->"CEAFBF" => "CEAFBFCEAFBF"
5. Apply rule 3: "C"->"CEAFBF" => "CEAFBFEAFBFEAFBF"
We need to add CE to the end. This is not possible.
