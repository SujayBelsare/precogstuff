The question is whether [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] is optimal.

"EBDDB"
1. "BFEBDDB"
2. "BFBFEBDDB"
3. "BFBFBFEBDDB"
4. "BFBFBFBFEBDDB"
5. ""

The target string is "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". I have "EBDDB". I need to transform "EBDDB" to "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". The only transition that does that is repeatedly applying transition 1.

Since I must end with transition 2 to get to "", and transition 1 is the only way to add characters to the string, I can't see any other way to do it.

So the solution [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] is optimal.

STOP.
