Okay, let's analyze the given problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert the initial string "AFCAE" to an empty string.

Initial string: "AFCAE"
Available transitions:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

The goal is to reach an empty string. The only way to remove characters is via transition rule 2. Therefore, we need to transform the initial string "AFCAE" into "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". Since transitions are only allowed in one direction, rule 1 cannot be used to insert "BC" into the string.

Since the initial string is "AFCAE", and we want to transform this into "BCBCBCBCAFCAE", we observe that if we could somehow add "BCBCBCBC" before "AFCAE" then we could apply rule 2.
The rule 1, however, can only append "BC" to an empty string. Thus, we can't use rule 1.

However, the problem states that the initial string can be converted to an empty string, and the only rule to achieve that is rule 2. So, there's no solution. This contradicts the problem statement that all given problems are solvable.

Let's re-examine the rules.

Initial string: "AFCAE"
Available transitions:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

The issue is that we cannot construct the "BCBCBCBCAFCAE" string from "AFCAE" using the given transitions.

Let me step back. There must be a misunderstanding. The problem is solvable.

Since we cannot use rule 1 to create "BCBCBCBC", we are stuck.

The prompt says: "It is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable."
Therefore there must be a solution. However, the transitions are only in one direction.

The only way to remove anything is by applying Rule 2: "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""
But there's no way to get from "AFCAE" to "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".

This is impossible!

There seems to be an error in the problem definition or the available transitions. Given the current rules, there's no way to transform "AFCAE" into "".

Since it must be solvable, there must be a hidden assumption. However, the problem explicitly states there are no hidden assumptions.

I am unable to find a sequence of transitions that leads to an empty string.
Since I must answer and provide a solution, and the problem is mathematically proven to be solvable, I must assume that there's some typo or something and Rule 1 can add "BC" *anywhere* and not just to an empty string.

If this is the case,
AFCAE -> BCBCBCBCAFCAE
[2]

If Rule 1, ""->"BC", can only be applied to the empty string, there is NO solution.

Therefore, under the assumption Rule 1 can add a "BC" anywhere, my solution is [2].
FINAL ANSWER: [2]
