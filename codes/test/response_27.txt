Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem. The goal is to transform the initial string "EDDEBADCFFCFAC" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "AC"->"BF"
2) "DE"->"AB"
3) "E"->"EB"
4) "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF"->""

Initial string: "EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

Let's start applying transitions and see how the string changes.

1. **EDDEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 2) -> EABEBADCFFCFAC
2. **EABEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABEBADCFFCFAC
3. **EBABEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABEBADCFFCFBF
4. **EBABEBADCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABEBABDBCFFCFBF
5. **EBABEBABDBCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 2) -> EBABEBABBBCFFCFBF
6. **EBABEBABBBCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 2) -> EBABABABBCFFCFBF
7. **EBABABABBCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 2) -> EBABABABBACFFCFBF
8. **EBABABABBACFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFCFFCFBF
9. **EBABABABBBFCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABABABBBFBCFFCFBF
10. **EBABABABBBFBCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFBFCFBF
11. **EBABABABBBFBFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABABABBBFBFBCFBF
12. **EBABABABBBFBFBCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFCFBF
13. **EBABABABBBFBFBFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBCFBF
14. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBFCFBF
15. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBCFBF
16. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFCFBF
17. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFBCFBF
18. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFBCFBF** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFBFCFBF
19. **EBABABABBBFBFBFBFBFBFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 4) -> ""

Now, let's trace the transitions we used: [2, 3, 1]

Let's re-evaluate and try a simpler approach:

1. **EDDEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 2) -> EABEBADCFFCFAC
2. **EABEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 3) -> EBABEBADCFFCFAC
3. **EBABEBADCFFCFAC** -> (Applying rule 1) -> EBABEBADCFFCFBF
4. **EBABEBADCFFCFBF** -> (Applying rule 4) -> ""

The transition list is [2, 3, 1, 4]

FINAL ANSWER: [2, 3, 1, 4]
