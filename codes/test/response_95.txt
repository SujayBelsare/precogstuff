Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "9C48701F4"

Available transitions:
1) "01"->"7A0"
2) "77A0F"->"487774A"
3) "4848"->"AB"
4) "9C"->"FD"
5) "7774"->"A28C4"
6) "28C"->"48374"
7) "FDABA483744A4"->""

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1.  Apply transition 4: "9C"->"FD".
    "9C48701F4" becomes "FD48701F4"

2.  Apply transition 1: "01"->"7A0".
    "FD48701F4" becomes "FD4877A0F4"

3. There is no applicable transition. Let's backtrack and explore other paths. From the Initial String, "9C48701F4", transition 5 does not apply, transition 6 does not apply.

Let's try to make "FDABA483744A4". We already have FD. Let's try to get 48374.
From FD48701F4:
Apply transition 1: "01"->"7A0"
"FD48701F4" becomes "FD4877A0F4"
Now there is no 77A0F.

Let's try again.
Initial string: "9C48701F4"

1. Apply transition 4: "9C"->"FD".
"9C48701F4" becomes "FD48701F4"

2. Apply transition 1: "01"->"7A0"
"FD48701F4" becomes "FD4877A0F4"

3. Apply transition 2: "77A0F"->"487774A"
"FD4877A0F4" becomes "FD48487774A4"

4. Apply transition 3: "4848"->"AB"
"FD48487774A4" becomes "FDAB7774A4"

5. Apply transition 5: "7774"->"A28C4"
"FDAB7774A4" becomes "FDABA28C4A4"

6. Apply transition 6: "28C"->"48374"
"FDABA28C4A4" becomes "FDABA483744A4"

7. Apply transition 7: "FDABA483744A4"->""
"FDABA483744A4" becomes ""

Solution:
[4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
