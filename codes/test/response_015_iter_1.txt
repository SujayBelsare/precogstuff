Okay, John Watson suggests applying the first transition multiple times. Let's explore that.

Initial string: "BCECE"
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

"BCECE" -> "BCEA" (Rule 1)

Now, we need to somehow get "BBBBBBBCEA". We have "BCEA". We need 6 more "B"s. Rule 2 only applies to the empty string. Applying rule 1 multiple times doesn't seem to help directly.

Let's reconsider the goal: reduce to empty string. We have "BCEA". We need "BBBBBBBCEA" to use rule 3.

The problem is that we can't add "B"s.

Let's re-examine the initial string and transitions. Is there anything we missed?

"BCECE"
1) "ECE"->"EA"
2) ""->"BB"
3) "BBBBBBBCEA"->""

We start with "BCECE". Applying rule 1 gives "BCEA". To use rule 3, we need "BBBBBBBCEA". We are short 6 "B"s. Since rule 2 can only be applied to the empty string, we can't use it to create the necessary "B"s.

Let's think step by step. We have "BCECE".
1. Apply rule 1: "BCECE" -> "BCEA". Now we have "BCEA".
2. We want to reach "BBBBBBBCEA". We need to add 6 "B"s at the beginning.
3. There's no direct way to add "B"s.

Let's call John Watson again.
JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Are you sure that the first transition can only be applied once? Remember that the rule says that it applies to the *first* matching substring.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
