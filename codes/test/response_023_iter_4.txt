Okay, I think I finally understand. The key is to realize the implication of "Each transition modifies *only the first* matching substring." We need to apply rule 4 FIRST, and then work backward. This means we have to *create* CBCBEBAEEDF at the beginning of the string.

Initial string: "EDFDDBECF"
Goal: ""
Transitions:
1) "CF"->"DF"
2) "EDFDDBE"->"EBAEE"
3) ""->"CB"
4) "CBCBEBAEEDF"->""

1. Apply rule 3: "" -> "CB"
   EDFDDBECF -> CBEDFDDBECF

Now we have "CBEDFDDBECF". We need "CBCBEBAEEDF".

2. Apply rule 3 again: "" -> "CB"
   CBEDFDDBECF -> CBCBEDFDDBECF

Now we have "CBCBEDFDDBECF".

The goal is "CBCBEBAEEDF". We need to somehow transform "EDFDDBECF" into "EBAEEDF".

Let's ignore the CBCB at the beginning for now. We want to transform EDFDDBECF into EBAEEDF.

1. Apply Rule 1: CF -> DF
   EDFDDBECF -> EDFDDBEDF

2. Apply Rule 2: EDFDDBE -> EBAEE
   EDFDDBEDF -> EBAEEDF

So, we've deduced the following steps:

1. Apply rule 3: "" -> "CB"
   EDFDDBECF -> CBEDFDDBECF

2. Apply rule 3: "" -> "CB"
   CBEDFDDBECF -> CBCBEDFDDBECF

3. Apply rule 1: CF -> DF
   CBCBEDFDDBECF -> CBCBEDFDDBEDF

4. Apply rule 2: EDFDDBE -> EBAEE
   CBCBEDFDDBEDF -> CBCBEBAEEDF

5. Apply rule 4: CBCBEBAEEDF -> ""
   CBCBEBAEEDF -> ""

Therefore, the transitions are [3, 3, 1, 2, 4]
