Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem. The goal is to transform "EDDAC" to "" using the provided transitions.

Initial string: "EDDAC"

Available transitions:
1) "EDDA"->"FF"
2) "C"->"CD"
3) "FFCDDD"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "EDDAC". "EDDA" is found at the beginning of the string.
EDDAC -> FFC
[1]

Step 2: Apply transition 2 to "FFC". "C" is found at the end of the string.
FFC -> FFCD
[1, 2]

Step 3: Apply transition 2 to "FFCD". "C" is found in the middle of the string.
FFCD -> FFCDD
[1, 2, 2]

Step 4: Apply transition 2 to "FFCDD". "C" is found in the middle of the string.
FFCDD -> FFCDDD
[1, 2, 2, 2]

Step 5: Apply transition 3 to "FFCDDD". "FFCDDD" matches the entire string.
FFCDDD -> ""
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Final Answer:
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
