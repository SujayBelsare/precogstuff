Okay, let's start.

Initial string: "40BB9DC"
Available transitions:
1) "40B"->"A5A"
2) "A5AB"->"4710E"
3) "4710E9DC"->"62D6576"
4) "D6"->"C2"
5) "62C25"->"30"
6) "0"->"83"
7) "38376"->""

First, I see "40B" at the beginning of the initial string, which matches transition 1.
"40BB9DC" -> "A5AB9DC" [1]

Now I have "A5AB9DC". I see "A5AB" at the beginning, which matches transition 2.
"A5AB9DC" -> "4710E9DC" [2]

Now I have "4710E9DC". This entire string matches transition 3.
"4710E9DC" -> "62D6576" [3]

Now I have "62D6576". I see "D6" in the middle, which matches transition 4.
"62D6576" -> "62C2576" [4]

Now I have "62C2576". I see "62C25" at the beginning, which matches transition 5.
"62C2576" -> "3076" [5]

Now I have "3076". I see "0" in the middle, which matches transition 6.
"3076" -> "38376" [6]

Now I have "38376". This entire string matches transition 7.
"38376" -> "" [7]

Therefore, the solution is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
