Okay, let's rethink the strategy. We need to transform "16323E51" into "". We have the final transition "16A1AAC976CC"->"", so we need to create that string. Let's work backward from that.

The target string is "16A1AAC976CC".
We have "16" at the start of our initial string "16323E51".
We also have "151" in "16323E51". "151" -> "976CC" (rule 4).
So, we need to get "16...151" to "16A1AAC976CC". That means we need to transform "323E" into "A1AA".

Let's try applying the transformations step by step:
1. "16323E51"
Apply rule 1: "3" -> "A3"
2. "16A323E51" (1)
Apply rule 2: "23E" -> "C1"
3. "16A3C151" (2)
This doesn't seem promising.

Let's try a different approach. Apply rule 5: "13" -> "AA"
1. "16323E51"
2. "16AA23E51" (5)
Apply rule 2: "23E" -> "C1"
3. "16AAC151" (2)
Now we have "16AAC151". We want "16A1AAC976CC".
Apply rule 3: "A" -> "A1"
4. "16A1AC151" (3)
Apply rule 4: "151" -> "976CC"
5. "16A1AC976CC" (4)
We are close. We need one more "A".
Let's try to replace C with A. We don't have a rule for that.

Let's go back and try to insert an "A" earlier.
"16323E51"
Apply rule 1 to the first "3": "3" -> "A3"
"16A323E51" (1)
Apply rule 1 to the second "3": "3" -> "A3"
"16A32A3E51" (1)
This is not helpful.

Let's try this again. We need "A1AA".
Apply rule 5: "13" -> "AA"
1. "16323E51"
2. "16AA23E51" (5)
Apply rule 2: "23E" -> "C1"
3. "16AAC151" (2)
Apply rule 3: "A" -> "A1"
4. "16A1AC151" (3)
We need an A between A1 and C.
Let's apply rule 3 again.
5. "16A1A1C151" (3)

We have "16A1A1C151".  We want "16A1AAC976CC".
Let's try rule 5 to "1C1". We don't have a rule for that.

Let's try a different starting point.
Start with "16323E51".
"16A1AAC976CC"

1. 16323E51
2. 163C151 (rule 2: 23E -> C1)
3. 16A3C151 (rule 1: 3 -> A3)
Doesn't seem to be working.

Let's try starting with rule 5 again.
1. 16323E51
2. 16AA23E51 (rule 5: 13 -> AA)
3. 16AAC151 (rule 2: 23E -> C1)
4. 16A1AC151 (rule 3: A -> A1)
5. 16A1AC976CC (rule 4: 151 -> 976CC)
We're at 16A1AC976CC. We need 16A1AAC976CC.

Let's insert 'A1' instead of 'A'.
1. 16323E51
2. 16AA23E51 (rule 5: 13 -> AA)
3. 16AAC151 (rule 2: 23E -> C1)
Now, we want "A1A". Let's try to create "13" again.
This isn't working.

Let's try applying rule 1 first:
1. 16323E51
2. 16A323E51 (rule 1: 3 -> A3)
3. 16A3C151 (rule 2: 23E -> C1)
4. 16A13C151 (rule 3: A -> A1)
5. 16A1AA C151 (rule 5: 13 -> AA)
This isn't right.

Let's try to work backwards from 16A1AAC976CC. We know 151 -> 976CC. So we need 16A1AA C 151.
We know A -> A1.

16323E51
16AA23E51 (5)
16AAC151 (2)
16A1AC151 (3)
16A1AC976CC (4)
16A1AAC976CC

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[5, 2, 3, 4]}$
