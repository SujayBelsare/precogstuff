Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "40BB9DC"

Available transitions:
1) "40B"->"A5A"
2) "A5AB"->"4710E"
3) "4710E9DC"->"62D6576"
4) "D6"->"C2"
5) "62C25"->"30"
6) "0"->"83"
7) "38376"->""

1. Apply transition 1 to "40BB9DC":
   "40BB9DC" -> "A5AB9DC"

2. Apply transition 2 to "A5AB9DC":
   "A5AB9DC" -> "4710E9DC"

3. Apply transition 3 to "4710E9DC":
   "4710E9DC" -> "62D6576"

4. Apply transition 4 to "62D6576":
   "62D6576" -> "62C2576"

5. Apply transition 5 to "62C2576":
   "62C2576" -> "3076"

6. Apply transition 6 to "3076":
   "3076" -> "38376"

7. Apply transition 7 to "38376":
   "38376" -> ""

Solution: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
