Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the solution.

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"
Available transitions:
1) "8"->"81"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DC811111BB86503B248"->""

The goal is to get an empty string. The only transition that leads directly to "" is rule 3. Therefore, we need to transform our initial string into "DC811111BB86503B248".

Initial string: "8BB86503B248"
Target: "DC811111BB86503B248"

The part "BB86503B248" is common between the initial and target strings. So we need to transform "8" into "DC811111".

We can add "DC" to the beginning using rule 2:

"8BB86503B248" -> "DC8BB86503B248"  [2]

Now we need to transform the first "8" into "811111". We can use rule 1 repeatedly.

"DC8BB86503B248" -> "DC81BB86503B248" [1]
"DC81BB86503B248" -> "DC811BB86503B248" [1]
"DC811BB86503B248" -> "DC8111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC8111BB86503B248" -> "DC81111BB86503B248" [1]
"DC81111BB86503B248" -> "DC811111BB86503B248" [1]

Now we have the target string for rule 3: "DC811111BB86503B248"

"DC811111BB86503B248" -> "" [3]

So, the final solution is: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]}$
