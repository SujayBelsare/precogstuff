Okay, let's work backward from the final state, "". The transition that leads to "" is transition 5: "FDCDFBFFAAF" -> "". So, we need to transform "EBAEACBFFEDBC" into "FDCDFBFFAAF".

Initial string: "EBAEACBFFEDBC"

1. **Apply transition 2: EBAEA -> FDF**
   This gives us: "FDFCBFFEDBC"
   [2]

2. **Apply transition 1: C -> DF**
   This gives us: "FDDFBFFEDBC"
   [2, 1]

3. **Apply transition 4: DF -> DC**
   This gives us: "FDDCBFFEDBC"
   [2, 1, 4]

Now we have "FDDCBFF".  We need "FDCDFBFFAAF".  So we need to change "DCBFF" to "CDFBFFAAF".  This is tricky.  Let's analyze again.

Initial string: "EBAEACBFFEDBC"

We want to get "FDCDFBFFAAF".

1. **Apply transition 2: EBAEA -> FDF**
   This gives us: "FDFCBFFEDBC"
   [2]

2. **Apply transition 1: C -> DF**
   This gives us: "FDDFBFFEDBC"
   [2, 1]

3. **Apply transition 4: DF -> DC**
   This gives us: "FDDCBFFEDBC"
   [2, 1, 4]

Now we have "FDDCBFFEDBC". We want to get "FDCDFBFFAAF".

We can't directly turn "DC" into "CD". Let's go back to the initial string and try a different path.

Initial string: "EBAEACBFFEDBC"

1. **Apply transition 1 to C: C -> DF**
   This gives us: "EBAEADFBFFEDBC"
   [1]

2. **Apply transition 2 to EBAEA: EBAEA -> FDF**
   This gives us: "FDFADFBFFEDBC"
   [1, 2]

This isn't getting closer to "FDCDFBFFAAF". Let's rethink.

Initial string: "EBAEACBFFEDBC"

1. **Apply transition 1 to C: C -> DF**
   This gives us: "EBAEADFBFFEDBC"
   [1]

2. **Apply transition 4 to DF: DF -> DC**
   This gives us: "EBAEADCFFEDBC"
   [1, 4]

3. **Apply transition 2 to EBAEA: EBAEA -> FDF**
   This gives us: "FDCFFEDBC"
   [1, 4, 2]

Now we have FDCFFEDBC. We want FDCDFBFFAAF.

This is difficult. Let's go back to the beginning.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply 1 to C: EBAEADFBFFEDBC
[1]
Apply 4 to DF: EBAEADCFFEDBC
[1, 4]

We want to get to FDCDFBFFAAF.
We need to create the substring "FDCDFBFFAAF".

From "EBAEADCFFEDBC", let's try applying transition 3 (EDBD -> AA). However, we don't have EDBD.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply 2 to EBAEA: FDFCBFFEDBC
[2]
Apply 1 to C: FDDFBFFEDBC
[2, 1]
Apply 4 to DF: FDDCBFFEDBC
[2, 1, 4]

Now we have "FDDCBFFEDBC". We need to transform this into "FDCDFBFFAAF".
We can't directly get there.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply transition 1: EBAEADFBFFEDBC
[1]

Apply transition 2: FDFADFBFFEDBC
[1, 2]

Still no luck.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply 2: FDFCBFFEDBC
[2]

Apply 1: FDDFBFFEDBC
[2, 1]

Apply 4: FDDCBFFEDBC
[2, 1, 4]

Let's think step by step. If we apply transition 5 we must have the string "FDCDFBFFAAF". Let us see if we can construct it.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply 2: FDFCBFFEDBC
[2]

Apply 1: FDDFBFFEDBC
[2, 1]

Apply 4: FDDCBFFEDBC
[2, 1, 4]

We have FDDCBFF. We need to reach FDCDFBFFAAF.

Let's try it again.

EBAEACBFFEDBC

Apply 1: EBAEADFBFFEDBC
[1]

Apply 4: EBAEADCFFEDBC
[1, 4]

Apply 2: FDCFFEDBC
[1, 4, 2]

Apply 1: FDCFDFFEDBC
[1, 4, 2, 1]

Apply 4: FDCFDCFEDBC
[1, 4, 2, 1, 4]

Apply 1: FDCFDFDFEDBC
[1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1]

This is getting nowhere.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 1, 4]}$
STOP
