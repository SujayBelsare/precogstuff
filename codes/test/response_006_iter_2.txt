Okay, I see. John Watson is pointing out that I missed a crucial detail: the empty string transition. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Initial string: "BCCBDDEC"
Transitions:
1) "DD"->"EF"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"->""

I need to somehow construct "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC" from "BCCBDDEC". The most unusual transition is the second one, ""->"DC". This allows insertion of "DC" anywhere.

Let's think backward. To get to the empty string, I need "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC". The initial string is "BCCBDDEC".

1. Apply transition 1 to "BCCBDDEC": "BCCBDEFEC".
2. Now I need to insert "DC" strategically to get "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".
Notice that I have "BCCBEFEC" in both strings. So I need to transform "BCCB" and "DEFEC" into "DCDCDC" and "BEFEC".
The difference between "BCCB" and "DCDCDC" is an insertion of "DC" twice and replacing B with D.
The difference between "DEFEC" and "BEFEC" is removing D.

Let's try inserting "DC" at the beginning using rule 2.
""->"DC"
So "BCCBDEFEC" -> "DCBCCBDEFEC". Not helpful.

Let's try a different approach. Since I need "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC", and I start with "BCCBDDEC", let's try to build the target string from left to right.
I need to prepend "DCDCDCB" to "CCBDDEC" to get "DCDCDCBCCBDDEC".
Then, I need to transform "DDEC" to "EFEC" to get "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".

Let's go back to the original string "BCCBDDEC".
If I apply rule 1, "DD" -> "EF", I get "BCCBDEFEC".
Now I need to create "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".
The "" -> "DC" rule is the key here.

Let's try inserting "DC" before everything:
"BCCBDDEC" -> "DCBCCBDDEC".
Apply "DD"->"EF": Not applicable.

Let's analyze the target "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC". It contains "BCCBEFEC". The initial string has "BCCBDDEC". So, "DD" needs to become "EF".

"BCCBDDEC" -> "BCCBDEFEC" (Rule 1)
Now, I need to insert "DC" strategically. I need "DCDCDCB". I have "BCCB".
I need to insert "DC" twice to get "DCDC". And I need to turn B to D.

I am still stuck. Let's try a completely different strategy.
"BCCBDDEC". I want to get "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".
Let's just focus on the beginning.
Let's insert DCs until we have enough: ""->"DC"
"BCCBDDEC" -> "DCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCDCBCCBDDEC"

So, I applied rule 2, three times in a row.
"BCCBDDEC" -> "DCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCDCBCCBDDEC".
Now I have "DCDCDCBCCBDDEC". I need "BEFEC". I have "DDEC".
If I apply rule 1 "DD"->"EF", I get "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".

So the solution is [2, 2, 2, 1, 3]
"BCCBDDEC" -> "DCBCCBDDEC"
"DCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCBCCBDDEC"
"DCDCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCDCBCCBDDEC"
"DCDCDCBCCBDDEC" -> "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"
"DCDCDCBCCBEFEC" -> ""
