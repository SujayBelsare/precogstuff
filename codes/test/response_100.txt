Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "167B5D"
Available transitions:
1) "167B"->"9E"
2) "9E5"->"B2"
3) "B2D"->"A1"
4) "A"->"BE5"
5) "E"->"27"
6) "751"->"F5"
7) "B2F5"->""

Here's the solution:

1. **Apply transition 1:** "167B"->"9E"
   "167B5D" becomes "9E5D"

2. **Apply transition 2:** "9E5"->"B2"
   "9E5D" becomes "B2D"

3. **Apply transition 3:** "B2D"->"A1"
   "B2D" becomes "A1"

4. **Apply transition 4:** "A"->"BE5"
   "A1" becomes "BE51"

5. **Apply transition 5:** "E"->"27"
   "BE51" becomes "B2751"

6. **Apply transition 6:** "751"->"F5"
   "B2751" becomes "B2F5"

7. **Apply transition 7:** "B2F5"->""
   "B2F5" becomes ""

Therefore, the solution is:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
