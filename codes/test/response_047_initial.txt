Okay, let's analyze the problem. The goal is to transform "BCFCE" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "CFCE"->"CB"
2) "BCB"->"CFFB"
3) ""->"EFA"
4) "FB"->"CFA"
5) "EFAEFACFCFA"->""

Initial string: "BCFCE"

Let's try applying the transitions and see where it leads us.

1.  "BCFCE" -> Applying transition 1: "CFCE"->"CB" results in "BCB".
2.  "BCB" -> Applying transition 2: "BCB"->"CFFB" results in "CFFB".
3.  "CFFB" -> Applying transition 4: "FB"->"CFA" results in "CFCFA".
Now, we are at "CFCFA". We need to somehow get to "EFAEFACFCFA" so that we can apply transition 5. It looks challenging.

Let's try a different approach. The target string for transition 5 is "EFAEFACFCFA". Notice that "EFA" appears multiple times, and we can insert "EFA" using transition 3: ""->"EFA". But we can't apply transition 3 to the middle of the string.

Let's go back to "BCFCE".
1. "BCFCE" -> Applying transition 1: "CFCE"->"CB" results in "BCB".
2. "BCB" -> Applying transition 2: "BCB"->"CFFB" results in "CFFB".

Now, we want to introduce "EFA". But we can only insert it into an empty string. Transition 4 converts "FB" to "CFA". Let's see if we can create "FB" somewhere.

Let's try another approach.
1. "BCFCE". Apply transition 1: "CFCE"->"CB" so we get "BCB"
2. "BCB". Apply transition 2: "BCB"->"CFFB" so we get "CFFB"
3. "CFFB". Apply transition 4: "FB"->"CFA" so we get "CFCFA"

Still at "CFCFA". Let's backtrack.
1. "BCFCE". Apply transition 1: "CFCE"->"CB" so we get "BCB"
Now we have "BCB".  We want "EFAEFACFCFA".
