Okay, let's start.
Initial string: "EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Available transitions:
1) "AC"->"BF"
2) "DE"->"AB"
3) "E"->"EB"
4) "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF"->""

First, I need to transform "EDDEBADCFFCFAC" to "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF" using transitions 1, 2, and 3.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
1. Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"

This is not leading anywhere. Let me start from the end.
I need to get "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF" from "EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBDBEBADCFFCFAC"

This also doesn't seem right. Let me rethink.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

This is not converging to the target.
Let's try focusing on the "AC" -> "BF" transition.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EDDEBADCFFCFBF"

Now I have "CFBF" near the end. The target has "CFBF" as well.
"EBBDABBADCFFCFBF"

"EDDEBADCFFCFBF"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABADCFFCFBF"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABADCFFCFBF"

Still not getting close.

Let me try applying rule 3 first.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBDBEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EBDABABADCFFCFAC"

This is also not leading anywhere.

Let me try a different approach. I need to find a sequence of transitions that will get me to "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF".

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"

Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EABEBA DCFFCFBF"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBEBEBA DCFFCFBF"

Still not closer.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBDBEBADCFFCFAC"

Maybe I am missing something obvious.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

The target string is "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF".

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"

Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EABEBADCF FCBF"

Let's start from the target and see how to get there.
"EBBDABBADCFFCFBF"

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

Apply rule 2: DE -> AB

"EABEBADCFFCFAC"
Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EDDEBADCF FCBF"

I am stuck.
JW HELP!
STOP
