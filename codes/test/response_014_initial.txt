Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. The goal is to transform "DAFBA" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "B"->"FC"
2) ""->"FB"
3) "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

Initial string: "DAFBA"

Let's start by trying to apply the rules directly. Rule 1 transforms "B" into "FC". Rule 2 adds "FB" to an empty string, which is not useful at the start. Rule 3 reduces a very specific string to an empty string, which is our ultimate goal.

The initial string is "DAFBA". Let's try applying Rule 1 to the "B":

DAFBA -> DAFCA

Now we have "DAFCA". We need to somehow get to "FFCFBDAFFCA".
It seems like we need to introduce "FF" and "BDAFF".

Since rule 2 allows us to add "FB" to an empty string, it might be useful later, but let's keep it in mind.

Let's try a different starting approach. Instead of focusing on the "B" in "DAFBA", let's see if we can work backward from the target string "FFCFBDAFFCA". We need to somehow introduce "FFCFBDAFFCA" into our initial string. This seems difficult.

Let's go back to applying rule 1 to DAFBA.
DAFBA -> DAFCA

Now, let's analyze the target string "FFCFBDAFFCA". We have "DAFCA" currently.  We need to introduce the following: "FF", change D to F, introduce B, and then "AFFCA".

Let's consider what happens if we apply rule 1 repeatedly after the first application:
DAFBA -> DAFCA
No other "B" to transform.

Let's think about the transitions needed to get from DAFCA to FFCFBDAFFCA.

DAFCA->FFCFBDAFFCA requires the following steps:
1. Insert FF at the beginning
2. Replace D with B
3. Insert BDA
4. Insert F

Now, since we have "DAFCA", and we want to reach "FFCFBDAFFCA", let's think about how to introduce "FF", "B", "D", "A", "FF".

Let's analyze the target string "FFCFBDAFFCA" more closely. It has "B" in it. The only way to introduce "B" is either through Rule 2 which we cannot use in the middle of the string, or it must be a result of reversing the string.

Let's try a different approach. We need to get to "FFCFBDAFFCA". We start with "DAFBA".
Let's apply Rule 1:
DAFBA -> DAFCA
We need to transform DAFCA into FFCFBDAFFCA.

Let's try to think backward from the target.

The target is FFCFBDAFFCA. What could the string have been before this transition?

Nothing, since it's the empty string transformation.

We have DAFBA. Let's try rule 1 again:
DAFBA -> DAFCA

Let's look at rule 3 again:
"FFCFBDAFFCA"->""
Let's try to work backwards.

DAFBA
Apply rule 1:
DAFCA

We want to introduce FFCFBDAFFCA.

Let's think about the number of characters in the initial and final string.
DAFBA: Length 5
FFCFBDAFFCA: Length 11

Let's try to focus on creating the target string.

Let's list out the differences between DAFCA and FFCFBDAFFCA:
1.  Two F's are added at the beginning.
2.  The D is changed to B.
3. BDA is added
4. A is added.

We start with DAFBA. Applying rule 1 gets us DAFCA.

We need to add "FF", change D to F, add "BDA", add "FFCA".

Since we can't insert in the middle, and we can only modify the first matching substring, let's rethink the entire approach.

Let's look at each rule and see if it helps or not.
1) "B"->"FC" - Changes a B to FC
2) ""->"FB" - Adds FB to an empty string
3) "FFCFBDAFFCA"->"" - The target string

We start with DAFBA.
DAFBA. We apply rule 1 to get DAFCA.
DAFCA.
Let's try to add FB using rule 2. However, rule 2 only applies to empty strings, so it is useless at this point.

Let's explore something radical. Is it possible that there is no solution? No, it's stated that all problems are solvable.

Let's go back to basics. DAFBA. Apply rule 1. DAFCA.
We need to get to FFCFBDAFFCA.
Let's enumerate all the possible transitions. We have only 1 applicable transition.

DAFBA -> DAFCA (Rule 1)

From DAFCA, what can we do? Nothing.

It looks like John Watson is needed.
