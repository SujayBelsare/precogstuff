Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "BBBCAFBDEC". We want to reach an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Let's try applying the transitions and see where they lead.

Starting with "BBBCAFBDEC":

1.  Applying transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
    "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

2. Applying transition 2 is not directly applicable.

3. Applying transition 3 is not directly applicable.

4. Applying transition 4 is not directly applicable.

5. Applying transition 5 is not directly applicable.

Let's try a different approach. We need to create "BFBBC" to use the final transition.

Starting with "BBBCAFBDEC":

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
    "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

Now let's see if we can work towards creating "BFBBC". We have "BBBFBCAFFBCA". This doesn't seem promising.

Let's go back to the initial string "BBBCAFBDEC". Maybe we should focus on getting rid of "CAFBDEC" first.

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
   "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

We need to somehow get "BFBBC" to be at the beginning of the string. Let's look at the transitions again.
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Maybe we need to create "BBFFB" somewhere.

Starting with "BBBCAFBDEC":

1. Apply transition 1 (CAFBDEC -> FFBCA):
   "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

We are stuck. Let's try a different path. We need "BFBBC". We have "BBB" at the beginning.

Let's try to create "FFE" using transition 3 or 4.
"EBDCA"->"FFE"
"FFE"->"BBC"

"BBBCAFBDEC"

Let's think backwards. To get to "", we need "BFBBC".
So, before that, we must have "BFBBC".
Before that, we could have "BFFFE" using transition 4 in reverse.
Before that, we could have "BEBDCA" using transition 3 in reverse.

This approach is not efficient.

Let's analyze the available transitions again.
1) "CAFBDEC"->"FFBCA"
2) "BBFFB"->"FEBD"
3) "EBDCA"->"FFE"
4) "FFE"->"BBC"
5) "BFBBC"->""

Let's try applying transition 1 and see what happens.
"BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"

Now, we need to create "BFBBC". The second transition "BBFFB"->"FEBD" can be applied.

"BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BFEBDCAFFBCA" (Applying transition 2 on the substring "BBBFB")

Now what? We have "BFEBDCAFFBCA". We need "BFBBC".

Let's go back to the start.

"BBBCAFBDEC"

1. Apply transition 1: "BBBCAFBDEC" -> "BBBFBCAFFBCA"
2. Apply transition 2: "BBBFBCAFFBCA" -> "BFEBDCAFFBCA"

We need to create "BFBBC". Let's try a different approach. We could try to make the string "BBFFB" so we can apply transition 2.

"BBBCAFBDEC"
