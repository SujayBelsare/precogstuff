Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We want to transform "CEEDDDCCBBEA" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Initial string: "CEEDDDCCBBEA"

Available transitions:
1) "EED"->"FDDAD"
2) "DADDDCCB"->"FACDEFDF"
3) "FD"->"BE"
4) "EF"->"FB"
5) "ACDEF"->"BF"
6) "CBFBBFDFBEA"->""

Let's try to apply the rules and see what happens.
We can't apply rule 1 immediately. Let's look for other possibilities.

We could try to make the string look more like the left-hand side of rule 6, since that leads directly to the empty string. This means aiming for a "CBFBBFDFBEA" structure.

First, let's find a substring that matches the left side of any of our transition rules.
The first substring we find is "EE". We want "EED", so we look for a "D". This is located directly after. So we apply rule 1.

CEEDDDCCBBEA -> CFDDADDDDCCBBEA [1]

Now we have "FDDADDDDCCBBEA". We are still trying to get to "CBFBBFDFBEA".

We can try to apply rule 2 "DADDDCCB"->"FACDEFDF". It looks like we have something close to that structure.
FDDADDDDCCBBEA
We can apply rule 2:
CFACDEFDFDCCBBEA [2]

Now the string is "CFACDEFDFDCCBBEA".
Let's look for more opportunities to reduce the string. We have "ACDEF" in our string. This matches rule 5!
CFBFDFDCCBBEA [5]

Now we have "CFBFDFDCCBBEA".
Let's try to apply rule 3 "FD"->"BE". This gives us:
CFBFBECCBBEA [3]

Now we have "CFBFBECCBBEA".

Let's try to apply rule 3 again "FD"->"BE".  We don't have FD.
Let's apply rule 4 "EF"->"FB". We don't have EF.
Let's apply rule 5 "ACDEF"->"BF". We don't have ACDEF.
Let's apply rule 6 "CBFBBFDFBEA"->"" . We don't have CBFBBFDFBEA.

Let's analyze "CFBFBECCBBEA".

It seems we made a mistake and we are stuck. Let's try a different approach.
