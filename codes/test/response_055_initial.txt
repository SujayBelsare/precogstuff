Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We need to transform "FEBACDD" into "".

Available transitions:
1) "EBA"->"BAFBB"
2) "BC"->"EC"
3) "FBA"->"BA"
4) "FBE"->"BB"
5) "BABECDD"->""

Initial string: "FEBACDD"

Let's start by trying to apply the rules. We can't directly apply rule 5 yet, as we don't have "BABECDD".

We can apply rule 3: FBA -> BA. This gives us:
FEBACDD -> EBACDD

Now, we can try rule 1: EBA -> BAFBB.
EBACDD -> BAFBBCDD

This doesn't seem helpful, let's try a different approach. Let's look for ways to create "BABECDD".
We have "FEBACDD". Let's see if we can get an 'E' between the 'B' and 'A'.

If we apply rule 3: FBA -> BA to "FEBACDD", we get "EBACDD".
Then applying rule 1: EBA -> BAFBB to "EBACDD" is not a good move because of length issues.

Let's start by trying to remove the F. We can't directly remove it. Let's try to move it.
We can apply rule 3: FBA -> BA.
FEBACDD -> EBACDD

Now we have "EBACDD". We need to get to "BABECDD". We can try to generate the required components through the rules.
Let's try to get a "BAB" first.

Applying rule 1 to "EBACDD" gives "BAFBBCDD".
Applying rule 3 is more promising.

Let's explore another path. If we can somehow change FBE to BB, then we could get something like BBACDD, which could potentially be easier.
But we don't have FBE directly.

Let's go back to "FEBACDD". Let's apply rule 3: FBA -> BA
"FEBACDD" -> "EBACDD"

Now let's apply rule 1: EBA -> BAFBB
"EBACDD" -> "BAFBBCDD"

Now let's apply rule 3: FBA -> BA
"BAFBBCDD" -> "BABBCDD"

We are close! Now we need an 'E' between 'B' and 'C'. We have BC in the string. Rule 2 changes BC to EC.
"BABBCDD" -> "BABECDD"

Finally, we can apply rule 5: "BABECDD" -> ""
"BABECDD" -> ""

The sequence of rules is [3, 1, 3, 2, 5].

```
FEBACDD -> EBACDD (3)
EBACDD -> BAFBBCDD (1)
BAFBBCDD -> BABBCDD (3)
BABBCDD -> BABECDD (2)
BABECDD -> "" (5)
```

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[3, 1, 3, 2, 5]}$
