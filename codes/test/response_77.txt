Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. The initial string is "27B39FE" and we want to make it empty using the given transitions:

1) ""->"07"
2) "0727B3"->"6C57"
3) "C579F"->"ED2C2F7"
4) "0707076ED2C2F7E"->""

Let's try to work backward from transition 4 to get an idea of what we need to make. It requires "0707076ED2C2F7E". This contains "ED2C2F7", which can be made from "C579F" using transition 3. So, let's try to create "C579F" and surround it with the other necessary characters.

We start with "27B39FE". We need to make "C579F" from the middle.
We could add "07" to the beginning using transition 1. But it doesn't seem helpful at this stage.

Let's try to create "0727B3". Since we have "27B3", let's add "07" to the beginning using transition 1. But this isn't allowed since the transition would be applied to the empty string, not the beginning of "27B39FE".

Looking at transition 2, "0727B3"->"6C57". We have "27B3" in our initial string, so we need "07" before it. It seems we cannot get it.

Let's try something else. We need to create "0707076ED2C2F7E". The "ED2C2F7" part can be created using "C579F". Let's try to create "C579F". We have "9FE" at the end.

Let's focus on creating "C579F" using transition 3. To get "ED2C2F7", we need "C579F". We have "27B39FE", so if we could transform the start to "C57", we would be getting closer.

Let's assume we have "C579F" at some point. Then we can get "ED2C2F7". We want "0707076ED2C2F7E". So, we would want "0707076" before "ED2C2F7" and "E" after.

Let's consider transition 2: "0727B3"->"6C57". If we could get "0727B3" we would have "6C57". Our initial string is "27B39FE". Adding "07" to the beginning doesn't work.

Here's a possible solution path:
1. Apply transition 1 (empty string -> "07") three times: "", "", "" -> "07", "07", "07"
   This is not possible.

Let's try to build up the final string from the end. We need "...ED2C2F7E". This "ED2C2F7" comes from "C579F". We have "27B39FE". How can we get C57 before 9F?

We have to apply transition 3 somewhere. Let's assume we can create C579F. Then, we get ED2C2F7. Let's work backwards to see where we can get.
Let's focus on creating C579F. We have 27B39FE.

Let's try a new approach. Try to isolate the useful substring in initial string "27B39FE"
"C579F" is the only one that can be converted using transition 3. If we could make initial string "C579F", then we can transform it.

Let's look at transition 2: "0727B3"->"6C57".
So if we get "0727B3", then we get "6C57".

The only way to eliminate "27B39FE" is to use rules 2 and 3, and finally 4.
Let's consider transition 3: "C579F"->"ED2C2F7". We have "27B39FE".

After several attempts and careful consideration, here's the solution:

1. Apply transition 1 ( "" -> "07") seven times. It cannot be applied at the beginning of the string. It must start with an empty string. We can't apply transition 1 initially.

Let's analyze this again:
The Initial string is "27B39FE".
We want it to become "".

We need to get "0707076ED2C2F7E" somehow. "ED2C2F7" comes from "C579F". So we need to create "C579F" from "27B39FE" somehow.

The only applicable transformations are these:
""->"07"
"0727B3"->"6C57"
"C579F"->"ED2C2F7"
"0707076ED2C2F7E"->""

There must be a trick to make the empty string.

After further analysis, there is no possible solution path. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable.
