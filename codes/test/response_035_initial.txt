Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully.

Initial string: "DBFFA"
Available transitions:
1) "DBFF"->"DFF"
2) ""->"EF"
3) "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->""

The goal is to reach an empty string. The only transition that leads to an empty string is rule 3, which requires a very specific string: "EFEFEFEFDFFA".

Currently, we have "DBFFA". Let's see if we can transform this into "EFEFEFEFDFFA".

We can't directly apply rule 1 because it shortens the string and removes necessary characters. Rule 2 adds "EF" to an empty string, which isn't useful at this stage.

It seems like we need to find a way to introduce "EFEFEFEFDFFA" somehow. Since we start with "DBFFA", let's try working backward from "EFEFEFEFDFFA".

Since rule 3 leads to "", we need to create "EFEFEFEFDFFA". We can't directly create this string from "DBFFA" using rules 1 and 2. It seems impossible to achieve the target string.

However, rule 2 adds "EF" to an empty string. The only way to make an empty string is to apply rule 3. This creates a paradox.

I'm stuck. Let me invoke JW.
