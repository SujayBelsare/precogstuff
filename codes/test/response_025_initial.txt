Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully.

Available transitions:
1) "BC"->"FD"
2) "D"->"DC"
3) "A"->"BF"
4) "FDCCBBFA"->""

Initial string: "BCBAA"

Goal: ""

Let's try a few steps:
BCBAA -> FD BAA (1)
FDBAA -> FD BFBFA (3)
This doesn't seem to be leading anywhere useful.

Let's try another approach. We need to somehow get to "FDCCBBFA". Let's see if we can build up the string from the beginning.

BCBAA -> FD BAA (1)
BCBAA -> BC BF BF (3,3)
BCBAA -> FD BF BF (1, 3, 3)

Let's try to apply rule 3 first.

BCBAA -> BC BFB F (3)
BCBAA -> FDBF BF (1, 3)
BCBAA -> FD BA BF (3)
FD BAA -> FD BF BF (3)

Let's work backward from the goal "FDCCBBFA". We need to get this exact string. We have the following transitions:
"BC"->"FD"
"D"->"DC"
"A"->"BF"

Let's try applying the rules to the initial string to match the goal string.
BCBAA

1) BC -> FD
FD BAA
We now have FD at the beginning. The goal has FD.

2) D -> DC
FD BAA
We don't have any D's.

3) A -> BF
FD BAA -> FD BF BF

The goal is FDCCBBFA

Let's try another approach.
We want to transform BCBAA into FDCCBBFA

BCBAA
Apply (3) twice:
BCBFBF
Apply (1):
FDBFBF

This doesn't seem right.

Let's try to create the string backwards

FDCCBBFA

A -> BF, so FA -> FBF
D -> DC so FD -> FDC

BC -> FD so FD -> BC

Let's think step by step.
BCBAA
We want to get FDCCBBFA

Let's apply rule 3 twice.

BCBAA -> BCBFBF

Now we apply rule 1.

BCBFBF -> FDBFBF

This doesn't look right.

Let's analyze the goal. FDCCBBFA.
The important part is the A at the end.

So the last step must be A -> BF.
So the string before the last step must be FDCCBBF.

Let's try to transform BCBAA into FDCCBBF.

BCBAA -> BCBFBF (3,3)
BCBFBF -> FDBFBF (1)

This doesn't work.

Let's try something else.
BCBAA
Apply rule 3 once:
BCBFA
Now, we need to get two C's, two B's, and an F before the A.
The only way to get C is from D -> DC
The only way to get B is from A -> BF.

Let's try this order.

BCBAA
BCBFA (3)
Let's use transition 1 on the first two characters.
FDBFA (1)
Now we have the FD.

Let's apply rule 2 on the D

FDCBFA (2)

Now we need another C.

FDCBFA (2)
FDCCBFA
Now we need another B.

FDCCBFA (3)
FDCCBBFA

So the steps are:
3, 1, 2, 2, 3

Solution: [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]
