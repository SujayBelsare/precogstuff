Okay, I see. John Watson is pointing out that I might be missing an application of rule 1. Let's re-examine the initial string "DAFBA". Rule 1 says "B"->"FC". I was focusing on the B at the end of the string. However, the problem statement says that transitions modify the *first* matching substring. There is no B in the initial string "DAFBA" to be replaced with "FC".

Let me rethink this from the beginning.

Initial string: "DAFBA"
Goal: "FFCFBDAFFCA"

Rule 1: "B"->"FC"
Rule 2: ""->"FB"
Rule 3: "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

The goal is to transform "DAFBA" into "FFCFBDAFFCA".

Let's analyze the differences:
- "DA" needs to become "FFCFBD"
- "F" stays as "F"
- "BA" needs to become "AFFCA"

Since rule 2 adds "FB" to the beginning, it is not relevant right now. Rule 1 replaces B with FC.

I made a mistake. There IS a B in the initial string, "DAFBA". So the first step is to replace the "B" in "DAFBA" with "FC".

1. Apply rule 1: "DAFBA" -> "DAFFCA"

Now we have "DAFFCA" and we want to get "FFCFBDAFFCA". The difference is that "D" needs to become "FFCFBD" and the rest is the same.

Let's explore using rule 2. Since it adds FB to the beginning only, it is not useful in this case.

The only way forward is to use rule 2 at the very start, which would give us FBDAFBA. Then rule 1 gives us FCDAFBA. It does not seem useful.

Going back to DAFBA, and the goal state FFCFBDAFFCA:
The substring "DA" must become "FFCFBD". Since rule 1 only replaces Bs with FCs, we are stuck.

Let me call John Watson again.
JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Check rule number 2 again! When exactly is it applicable?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
