Okay, let's start. The initial string is "070B6C4" and the goal is "".

Available transitions:
1) "C4"->"B1E"
2) "70"->"DE"
3) "E"->"27"
4) "27B"->"1D"
5) "B1"->"CD9"
6) "0D1D6CD927"->""

First, let's analyze the initial string "070B6C4". We want to reach "0D1D6CD927".
We can apply transition 1: "C4"->"B1E" to get "070B6B1E".
So, "070B6C4" -> "070B6B1E" [1]

Now we have "070B6B1E". Let's apply transition 5: "B1"->"CD9" to get "070B6CD9E".
So, "070B6B1E" -> "070B6CD9E" [5]

Now we have "070B6CD9E". Let's apply transition 3: "E"->"27" to get "070B6CD927".
So, "070B6CD9E" -> "070B6CD927" [3]

Now we have "070B6CD927". Let's apply transition 2: "70"->"DE" to get "0DEB6CD927".
So, "070B6CD927" -> "0DEB6CD927" [2]

Now we have "0DEB6CD927". We want "0D1D6CD927". Let's apply transition 4: "27B"->"1D" to the original string "0DEB6CD927". However, "27B" is not present. We need to get "27B" somehow. This is tricky.

Let's rethink the approach. We must get "0D1D6CD927" somehow.
"070B6C4"
Apply transition 1: "C4"->"B1E"
"070B6B1E"
Apply transition 5: "B1"->"CD9"
"070B6CD9E"
Apply transition 3: "E"->"27"
"070B6CD927"
Apply transition 2: "70"->"DE"
"0DEB6CD927"

We are at "0DEB6CD927". We want "0D1D6CD927".
Let's see if we can create a "27B" somewhere. We have "EB" in the string.

Let's try a completely different approach. We need "0D1D6CD927".
Let's start by applying transition 2 to "070B6C4":
"070B6C4" -> "0DEB6C4" [2]

Now we have "0DEB6C4". Apply transition 1: "C4"->"B1E"
"0DEB6C4" -> "0DEB6B1E" [1]

Now we have "0DEB6B1E". Apply transition 5: "B1"->"CD9"
"0DEB6B1E" -> "0DEB6CD9E" [5]

Now we have "0DEB6CD9E". Apply transition 3: "E"->"27"
"0DEB6CD9E" -> "0DEB6CD927" [3]

Now we have "0DEB6CD927". We want "0D1D6CD927".
We need to convert "EB" to "1D".
Looking at the rules, we need "27B"->"1D". So, we need to create "27" from "E".
Transition 3: "E"->"27".

So, "0DEB6CD927" doesn't seem to work.
