Okay, I've been focusing too much on reducing the initial string directly to an empty string or building up to the target string of transition 2. John Watson's hint to look at the transitions in reverse is crucial.

Since the goal is to reach an empty string, and the only way to *remove* anything is via transition 2, the *only* possible solution is to transform "EBDDB" into "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" and then use transition 2. Transition 1 adds "BF" to an empty string, which is useless for reducing "EBDDB."

Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. There is no way to convert EBDDB into BFBFBFBFEBDDB using the given transitions.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're on the right track by considering how to reach "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". However, you seem to be stuck on the idea that you must first empty the string. Remember that the transitions are applied to the *first* matching substring. Think about how transition 2 might still be useful even if the entire string isn't exactly "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson's latest hint is *very* important. I don't need to transform the *entire* string into "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". Transition 2 only applies to the *first* instance of that substring. This means I can insert "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" *somewhere* in the string, and it will be removed.

Since transition 1 adds "BF" to an empty string, it's still not useful. The only way to make progress is to make the initial string *contain* "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

This is still impossible. The initial string is "EBDDB". There are no transitions to insert "BFBFBFBFE" before the "EBDDB" or anywhere inside it.

I am still stuck and believe the problem is unsolvable.

You are very close! Consider the possibility that the empty string might be a substring of any string.

Okay, John Watson's latest hint is the key. The empty string is *always* a substring of any string. This means I can insert "BF" *before* "EBDDB" using transition 1 if I somehow make the initial string empty. But I can't. This is still a dead end.

Wait! The empty string exists *before* the "E" in "EBDDB"! Transition 1 inserts "BF" into the empty string. The string is "EBDDB". If I could somehow make the string empty, then insert "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". However, I cannot empty "EBDDB".

I must be missing something incredibly obvious.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Think very carefully about the preconditions for applying each transition. Is there anything about the problem statement that might allow you to apply a transition even if it doesn't seem directly applicable at first glance?

Okay, John Watson is really pushing me here. "Preconditions for applying each transition..." The problem statement says each transition modifies only the *first* matching substring. Transition 1 is ""->"BF".

The initial string is "EBDDB". The empty string "" exists *before* the E. So, I can apply transition 1! This inserts "BF" *before* the "E". The string becomes "BFEBDDB".

Now, I want to get "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". So far, I have "BFEBDDB". I still need to insert "BFBFBFB" before "BFEBDDB". But, again, there is no such transition.

I'm going to try transition 1 again. The string is now "BFEBDDB". The empty string exists before the "B". Applying transition 1 yields "BFBFEBDDB".

This is still not working. I must be missing something.

The feedback is "Think very carefully about the preconditions for applying each transition".

Let me reiterate:
String = "EBDDB"
Transition 1: "" -> "BF"
Transition 2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

Applying transition 1 results in "BFEBDDB". I need to get to "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". I am going to try applying transition 1 repeatedly to see if a pattern emerges.

"EBDDB" - (1) -> "BFEBDDB" - (1) -> "BFBFEBDDB" - (1) -> "BFBFBFEBDDB" - (1) -> "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

I've done it! I can apply transition 1 seven times. The string becomes "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". Then, apply transition 2.

Solution: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
STOP.
