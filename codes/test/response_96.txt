Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem. We need to transform "4E387CC50" into an empty string using the provided transitions.

Initial string: "4E387CC50"

1. Apply transition 1 to "CC50": "4E387CC50" -> "4E387CAF"
   *   Transition 1: "C50"->"AF"

2. Apply transition 5 to "CAF": "4E387CAF" -> "4E38716"
   *   Transition 5: "CAF"->"16"

3. Apply transition 6 to "87": "4E38716" -> "4E369116"
   *   Transition 6: "87"->"691"

4. Apply transition 4 to "E3": "4E369116" -> "43D76C679F69116"
   *   Transition 4: "E3"->"3D76C679F"

5. Apply transition 2 to "4": "43D76C679F69116" -> "4B3D76C679F69116"
   *   Transition 2: "4"->"4B"

6. Apply transition 3 to "4B": "4B3D76C679F69116" -> "B63D76C679F69116"
   * Transition 3: "4B"->"B6"

7. Apply transition 7 to "B63D76C679F69116": "B63D76C679F69116" -> ""
   *   Transition 7: "B63D76C679F69116"->""

Therefore, the sequence of transitions is: [1, 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, 7]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, 7]}$
