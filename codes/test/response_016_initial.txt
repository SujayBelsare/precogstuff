Okay, let's analyze the problem. We have the initial string "AEAAD" and the following transitions:

1) "AE"->"CB"
2) "AD"->"DF"
3) "CBDF"->"BBB"
4) "BBBF"->""

Our goal is to reach an empty string. Let's try applying the rules systematically.

AEAAD -> (Rule 1) CBAAD
CBAAD -> (Rule 2) CBADF
CBADF -> (Rule 2) CBDFF - This doesn't seem right, let's go back.

Let's try applying rule 2 first:

AEAAD -> AEADF
AEADF -> (Rule 1) CBADF
CBADF -> (Rule 3) BBB
BBB - We can't apply rule 4, so this is a dead end.

Let's try applying rule 1 twice, then rule 2.

AEAAD -> CBAAD
CBAAD -> CBCBD. This is a dead end.

Let's try applying rule 2 first.

AEAAD -> AEADF -> (Rule 1) CBADF -> (Rule 3) BBB

Still a dead end. We need to get a "BBBF" to use rule 4. Rule 3 gives us BBB, but to get the F we need to use rule 2.

Let's try a different approach:
AEAAD -> CBAAD -> (Rule 2) CBADF -> (Rule 3) BBB.
BBB -> can't apply anything.

We want to get to "BBBF". Rule 3 gets us "BBB", so before rule 3, we need "CBDF".

CBDF -> BBB

So, we need CBDF.
AEAAD. Let's try to make CBDF

AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF. We got CBADF, but now what?

We're close.

AEAAD -> AEADF.
AEADF -> CBADF.

Now we can't directly get to BBBF. Let's try again.

AEAAD. Need to get CBDF

AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF.

We have CBADF. Now what?

It seems like we are going in circles. Let's think about what we need. We need BBBF.
So before that we need CBDF.
Before that? AEAAD.

AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF -> BBB.

We are stuck. Let's try something else.

AEAAD -> AEADF -> CBADF -> BBB.

Still stuck.

Let's re-examine the rules:
1) "AE"->"CB"
2) "AD"->"DF"
3) "CBDF"->"BBB"
4) "BBBF"->""

We need to create "BBBF". We can get "BBB" from "CBDF". To get "CBDF", we need "AE" and "AD" in the right order.

AEAAD.
Let's try to create CBDF another way.
AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF.
This creates CBADF
What if we do the AD transition *after* the AE transition?
AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF -> BBB.

What if we do AD *before* AE?
AEAAD -> AEADF -> CBADF -> BBB.

Still stuck.

I think I need to rethink this.

Let's try working backwards.

We need BBBF -> "". So, we need BBBF
Before that we need CBDF -> BBB
So, we need to make CBDF.

AEAAD.

AEAAD -> CBAAD. We need DF.
CBAAD -> CBADF. We did it!
CBADF -> BBB.
Now what?

Let's try this:
AEAAD -> AEADF -> CBADF -> BBB.
Still stuck.

Let's try this again.
AEAAD -> CBAAD -> CBADF -> BBB.
We are stuck.

Let's try this one more time:

AEAAD -> AEADF -> CBADF -> BBB. We are stuck.

Okay. I'm calling John Watson.
JW HELP!
