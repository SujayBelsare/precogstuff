Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "DFDDACBEC" to "" using the given transitions.

Transitions:
1) "DFDD"->"BEA"
2) "CBEC"->"CB"
3) ""->"EAC"
4) "EAC"->"EAE"
5) "EAEEACBEAACB"->""

Initial string: "DFDDACBEC"

First, let's look for direct matches in the initial string. We have "DFDD" and "CBEC". Let's apply transition 1:

DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC

Now, let's apply transition 2:

BEAACBEC -> BEAACB

We need to get to "EAEEACBEAACB". It looks like transition 3 and 4 will be useful. Since our goal is to get to the final transition, let's add "" to the end using transition 3. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is the only way to add "EAC":

BEAACB -> BEAACBEAC

Now apply transition 4:

BEAACBEAC -> BEAACBEAE

We are getting closer. Notice that we have "EAC" in transition 5. We also have "CB" in transition 2. Let's see if applying transition 3 at the end will help.

BEAACBEAE -> BEAACBEAEEAC

Now apply transition 4:

BEAACBEAEEAC -> BEAACBEAEEEAE

This is not going to work.

Let's go back to BEAACB.

BEAACB. We need the string to be "EAEEACBEAACB".
We can insert "" at various locations using rule 3 "EAC". We also have the rule "EAC"->"EAE".

Let's go back to the initial string.
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC (Rule 1)
BEAACBEC -> BEAACB (Rule 2)

We want to get to EAEEACBEAACB.
We have BEAACB.
Let's insert EAC in various locations.
BEAACB + EAC = BEAACBEAC

BEAACB -> BEAACBEAC (Rule 3)
BEAACBEAC -> BEAACBEAE (Rule 4)

This looks promising. Let's insert EAC after BEAACB with transition 3:
BEAACB -> BEAACBEAC

Now apply transition 4:
BEAACBEAC -> BEAACBEAE

Now insert EAC after that:
BEAACBEAE -> BEAACBEAEEAC

Let's try something else.
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC (Rule 1)

Let's try transition 3 at the beginning ""->"EAC". This is illegal since transition 3 should only be applied if the string is empty.

Let's consider adding EAC with transition 3 at the very beginning. This is not possible since we are starting with DFDDACBEC.
Let's go back to DFDDACBEC.
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC (Rule 1)
BEAACBEC -> BEAACB (Rule 2)

Now we have BEAACB.
We want EAEEACBEAACB.
We need to insert EAC somewhere.

Let's try a different approach.
Since we want to end up with EAEEACBEAACB, let's work backwards.
EAEEACBEAACB -> "" (Rule 5)
We want to get this string.
Let's start with DFDDACBEC.
DFDDACBEC -> BEAACBEC (1)
BEAACBEC -> BEAACB (2)
Now we have BEAACB.
We want to somehow get EAEEACBEAACB.

It seems like we need to use rules 3 and 4 to add EAE's and EAC's.
Let's try to add EAC after BEAACB.
BEAACB -> BEAACBEAC (3)
BEAACBEAC -> BEAACBEAE (4)

Now we have BEAACBEAE.
We want to get to EAEEACBEAACB.

Let's think outside the box.
DFDDACBEC
Apply rule 1: BEAACBEC
Apply rule 2: BEAACB
Apply rule 3: BEAACBEAC
Apply rule 4: BEAACBEAE
Let's apply rule 3 again: BEAACBEAEEAC
Apply rule 4 again: BEAACBEAEEEAE

This is not working.
JW HELP!
