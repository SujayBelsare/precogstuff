Okay, John Watson's feedback is invaluable. I've been too focused on applying rule 2 early. The key insight is that I can add "ED" to the beginning of the string as many times as I want.

The goal is to create "EDEDEDCAA". Rule 2 transforms "CBDA" to "AA".

Let's try this:
1. "CCBDA"
2. Add "ED" to the beginning until, after applying rule 2, I can get "EDEDEDCAA".

Let's say I add "ED" *n* times. The string becomes "ED...EDCCBDA".
After applying rule 2, "CBDA" -> "AA", the string becomes "ED...EDCCA".

I want this to become "EDEDEDCAA". This means I need *n* = 3.

So, the steps are:
1. "CCBDA"
2. "EDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
3. "EDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
4. "EDEDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
5. "EDEDEDCCA" (Rule 2)
Now, I need to get "EDEDEDCAA". I have "EDEDEDCCA". I need to remove the 'C'.
I can't remove the 'C'. I'm stuck again.

Let's try another approach. John Watson hinted at adding more "ED"s.

Suppose I add 4 "ED"s.
1. "CCBDA"
2. "EDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
3. "EDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
4. "EDEDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
5. "EDEDEDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
6. "EDEDEDEDCCA" (Rule 2)
I still can't remove the extra C.

The key is that I need "CAA" at the end. And I get "AA" from "CBDA".

Let's analyze "EDEDEDCAA". It has 3 "ED"s. I need to create this.

1. "CCBDA"
2. I add ED at the beginning some number of times.
3. I apply rule 2.
4. I need to have "EDEDEDCAA".

Let's try this approach.
1. "CCBDA"
2. "EDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
3. "EDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
4. "EDEDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
5. "EDEDEDCCA" (Rule 2)
Now I have "EDEDEDCCA". I want "EDEDEDCAA".
I can't remove the C.

I need to find a way to eliminate that extra 'C'.

Let's think outside the box. What if I add more than 3 EDs?
1. CCBDA
2. EDCCBDA
3. EDEDCCBDA
4. EDEDEDCCBDA
5. EDEDEDEDCCBDA
6. EDEDEDEDEDCCA (Rule 2)

Now I have EDEDEDEDEDCCA. I want EDEDEDCAA.

I'm still stuck.

I need to call for John Watson's help again.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're very close! Focus on the final transformation. You have "EDEDEDCCA" and want "EDEDEDCAA". What action can you take to achieve this? Remember rule 1!
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I see it now! John Watson's hint is perfect. I was so focused on creating "EDEDEDCAA" directly that I missed the obvious.

I have "EDEDEDCCA". I want "EDEDEDCAA". The only way to modify the string is to add "ED" at the beginning.

So, I add "ED" at the beginning: "EDEDEDEDCCA". Now I can apply rule 3: "EDEDEDCAA" -> "".

Here's the solution:
1. "CCBDA"
2. "EDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
3. "EDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
4. "EDEDEDCCBDA" (Rule 1)
5. "EDEDEDCCA" (Rule 2)
6. "EDEDEDEDCCA" (Rule 1)
7. "" (Rule 3)

The transitions are: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3]
