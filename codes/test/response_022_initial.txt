Let's analyze the given transitions and the initial string "BBEDF" to find a path to an empty string.

Available transitions:
1) "BBED"->"BB"
2) "BBF"->"DEC"
3) "C"->"CA"
4) "DECAA"->""

Initial string: "BBEDF"

We want to reach an empty string. The only rule that leads to an empty string is rule 4: "DECAA"->"". Therefore, we need to create "DECAA" from "BBEDF".

BBEDF -> ? -> DECAA

Let's try to apply the rules to the initial string:
1) "BBED"->"BB": Applying this to "BBEDF" would result in "BBF".
"BBEDF" -> "BBF"
2) "BBF"->"DEC": Applying this to "BBF" would result in "DEC".
"BBF" -> "DEC"
3) "C"->"CA": Applying this to "DEC" would result in "DECA".
"DEC" -> "DECA"
4) "DECAA"->"": We need one more "A". Applying the "C"->"CA" rule again to "DECA" would result in "DECAA".
"DECA" -> "DECAA"

So the steps are:
BBEDF -> BBF (Rule 1)
BBF -> DEC (Rule 2)
DEC -> DECA (Rule 3)
DECA -> DECAA (Rule 3)
DECAA -> "" (Rule 4)

The transition list is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]}$
