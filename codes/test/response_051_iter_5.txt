Okay, I'm not going to give up. I need to look at the initial string "BDEEEFC" and see which rules apply.

1. FC -> BE
2. "" -> CB
3. E -> EF
4. BBDEFEEB -> EBBB
5. BE -> AB
6. CEBBAB -> ""

The initial string is "BDEEEFC".
Rule 1 applies: FC -> BE. This would change the string to "BDEEEBE".

So, step 1: BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]

Now I have "BDEEEBE".
Rule 3 applies: E -> EF. I can apply this to any of the three Es.

Let's try applying it to the first E: BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE [3]
Now I have "BDFFEEBE".

Now let's try applying it to the second E: BDEEEBE -> BDEFEBE [3]
Now I have "BDEFEBE".

Now let's try applying it to the third E: BDEEEBE -> BDEEEFBE [3]
Now I have "BDEEEFBE".

Let's go back to "BDEEEBE" and try to apply rule 5: BE -> AB.
BDEEEBE -> BDEEEAB [5]

Okay, so starting with "BDEEEFC":
1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]

Now I have "BDEEEBE".
2. BDEEEBE -> BDEFEBE [3]

Now I have "BDEFEBE".
It seems I need to somehow create BBDEFEEB so that I can use rule 4.
Let's try applying rule 3 to all the Es.
BDEFEBE -> BDFFEFBE [3]
I have "BDFFEFBE".
I don't see a path to BBDEFEEB.

Let's go back to "BDEEEBE".
I'm going to try to create CEBBAB.
I need a CE and a BBAB.

Let's try BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]
BDEEEBE. Now I apply rule 3 to create EF, hoping to get a CE. I can't get CE that way.
I'm stuck again.

Then what? I can create EF from E.
BDEEEBE -> BDFFEEBE [3]

I'm still not seeing how to get to CEBBAB.

Let's think about how to get CEBBAB.
I need CE.
I can create BE with rule 1.
I need BBAB. I can create AB with rule 5.

I'm still missing something.
I am going to try a different approach.

1. BDEEEFC -> BDEEEBE [1]

3. BDEEFBE -> BDEEFAB [5]

It's just a string.
The rule 4 is just a transformation of one string to another.

The string BDEEEBE... it has a B at the beginning, then some Ds and Es, then a BE at the end.

Abstractly, the string is just a sequence of characters.
BBDEFEEB is also just a sequence of characters.
