Okay, I see. Transition 1 inserts "BF" at the beginning of the string. So, inserting "BF" doesn't change "EBDDB" into something useful.

The target string is "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". I have "EBDDB".

I need to somehow get rid of the "E".

I am still missing something.

Let's analyze the target string again: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".
If I could turn "EBDDB" into "BFBFBFBFEBDDB", I'd be done.

Transition 1: "" -> "BF"
Transition 2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

I am going to try a different approach entirely. I need to remove "EBDDB". I can't remove anything directly.

I am stuck.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Can you add something to the string that would allow you to use transition 2?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson is saying I need to *add* something. Transition 1 adds "BF". I have "EBDDB" and I want "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

If I could insert "BFBFBFBF" before "EBDDB" I could use transition 2.

Applying transition 1 gives "BFEBDDB". This doesn't help.

I am still missing it.

I give up.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Think about the simplest possible first step. There's only one option for the first transition.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson is saying the first step *must* be transition 1.
So I start with "EBDDB". I apply transition 1. I get "BFEBDDB".

Transition 1: "" -> "BF"
Transition 2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

I have "BFEBDDB". I want "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".
I need to add "BFBFBF" before "EBDDB".

I can't add anything in the middle of the string.

I am still stuck.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Focus on what transition 2 requires. You need "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". How can you get that from "BFEBDDB"?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson is saying that starting with "BFEBDDB", I need to get "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

"BFEBDDB"
"BFBFBFBFEBDDB"

I need to add "BFBFBF" after the first "BF".

Transition 1: "" -> "BF"
Transition 2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

Applying transition 1 to "BFEBDDB" gives "BFBFEBDDB". This doesn't seem right.

I still don't see the trick.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're overthinking it. You start with "EBDDB". Transition 1 gives you "BFEBDDB". What's next?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson is really trying to simplify this.

Start: "EBDDB"
1: "" -> "BF"
2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

"EBDDB" -> "BFEBDDB" (using transition 1)

Now what? I want "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". I have "BFEBDDB".

The difference is "BFBFBF" before the "E".

I give up.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You already used transition 1. Can you use it again? What would you get?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, John Watson is saying keep going with transition 1.

"EBDDB" -> "BFEBDDB" (transition 1)
Apply transition 1 again: "BFBFEBDDB"

Transition 1: "" -> "BF"
Transition 2: "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" -> ""

I want "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

"BFBFEBDDB"

I still don't see it.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
Keep using transition 1 until you can use transition 2.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I am going to just keep applying transition 1 until I get "BFBFBFBFEBDDB".

"EBDDB"
1. "BFEBDDB"
2. "BFBFEBDDB"
3. "BFBFBFEBDDB"
4. "BFBFBFBFEBDDB"

Now I have "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". Apply transition 2.

The solution is [1, 1, 1, 1, 2].

STOP.
