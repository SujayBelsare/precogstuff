Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully and derive the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "FEBFC"
Available transitions:
1) "FE"->"AD"
2) ""->"AD"
3) "AD"->"FF"
4) "FFADADADBFC"->""

1. Apply transition 1: "FE"->"AD"
   "FEBFC" -> "ADBFC"

2. Apply transition 3: "AD"->"FF"
   "ADBFC" -> "FFBFC"

3. Now, we need to somehow create the "FFADADADBFC" string to apply transition 4.  Since transition 2 is ""->"AD", it can insert "AD" into our string anywhere. We must strategically insert "AD"s. Let's focus on creating the needed sequence from left to right.

4. Apply transition 2: ""->"AD"
    "FFBFC" -> "FFADBFC"

5. Apply transition 2: ""->"AD"
    "FFADBFC" -> "FFADADBFC"

6. Apply transition 2: ""->"AD"
    "FFADADBFC" -> "FFADADADBFC"

7. Apply transition 4: "FFADADADBFC"->""
    "FFADADADBFC" -> ""

Therefore, the solution is: [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4]
