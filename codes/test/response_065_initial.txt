Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "EEFDDBBDFDEF" into an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "BDF"->"AA"
2) "BAADE"->"EFAA"
3) "E"->"BB"
4) "AF"->"FC"
5) "BBBBFDDEFAFC"->""

Initial string: "EEFDDBBDFDEF"

Let's apply the transitions step-by-step.

1. **EEFDDBBDFDEF** -> We can apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDEF**  [3]

2. **BBFDDBBDFDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDEF** [3]

3. **BBFDDBBDFDBBDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDEF** [3]

This seems like a dead end. Let's try a different approach. We want to create "BBBBFDDEFAFC". Let's apply rule 3 to all E's.

1. **EEFDDBBDFDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDEF** [3]

2. **BBFDDBBDFDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDEF** [3]

3. **BBFDDBBDFDBBDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDEF** [3]

4. **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDEF** -> Apply rule 3 to the last E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDBBDF** [3]

5. **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDBBDF** -> Apply rule 3 to the first E.
   **BBFDDBBDFDBBDBBDBBDF** [3]

This doesn't seem right. Let's go back to the original string.

**EEFDDBBDFDEF**

Let's try to create BDF using rule 3.
1. Apply rule 3 to the first E.
**BBFDDBBDFDEF** [3]

Now, can we create BDF? Yes, we already have it at the beginning.
Let's try to make BDF -> AA using rule 1
2. Apply rule 1 to "BDF"
**BBAADDBBDFDEF** [1]

Let's try to apply rule 3 to the remaining E's.
3. Apply rule 3 to E
**BBAADDBBDFDBBDF** [3]
4. Apply rule 3 to E
**BBAADDBBDFDBBDBBDF** [3]
5. Apply rule 3 to E
**BBAADDBBDFDBBDBBDBBDF** [3]

This is not going anywhere.

**EEFDDBBDFDEF**

Let's try to find the occurrences of BDF.
We have one "BDF" at index 2.

1. Apply rule 1
**EEAADBDFDEF** is incorrect
**EEAADB** is not a substring.

Let's try a different strategy.
What if we apply rule 3 to all E's first?
**EEFDDBBDFDEF** -> **BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF** [3,3,3,3]

Now we have multiple BDF.
BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF

Apply rule 1 twice.
BBBBFDDBBDFDBBDF -> BBBAADDBBDFDBBDF [1]
BBBAADDBBDFDBBDF -> BBBAADDAADDBBDF [1]

This still does not create the pattern.

Let's call for help.
JW HELP!
