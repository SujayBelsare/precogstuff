Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. The goal is to transform "FABFF" into "".

Available transitions:
1) "F"->"EE"
2) ""->"AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE"->""

Initial string: "FABFF"

Let's try applying rule 1 repeatedly to convert all F's to EE's.
FABFF -> EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE
Now the string is EEABEEEE.
The third rule "ACEEABEEEE"->"" seems like it will be useful, but we need "AC" at the beginning of the string. It seems impossible to generate the "AC" at the beginning using only the first rule. Rule 2 is ""->"AC", which seems useful only at the beginning.

Since rule 2 adds "AC" at the beginning, and rule 3 requires "ACEEABEEEE", let's see if we can make "EEABEEEE" from "FABFF".

FABFF -> EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE. Now we have "EEABEEEE".
We need "AC" in front, so ""->"AC". Applying rule 2 to the empty string, we get "AC". This does not help us now. However, if we apply rule 2 to the *end* after reducing the string, that will work. But that's not how this works since it only applies to the first matching substring.

Let's analyze this backwards. We want "ACEEABEEEE". To get this, we would need "EEABEEEE". To get this, we need "FABFF" -> "EEABEEF" -> "EEABEEEE"
FABFF -> EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE. This uses rule 1 twice. So we have [1, 1].
Then we need to add "AC" at the beginning, which is impossible.

Let's try a different approach. We are given "FABFF".
Rule 1: F -> EE
Rule 2: "" -> AC
Rule 3: ACEEABEEEE -> ""

If we apply rule 1 to all the F's, we get:
FABFF -> EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE
Now, we want ACEEABEEEE. We can only add AC at the beginning. So we apply rule 2 before any other rule does not help.

Let's try to go backwards again.
ACEEABEEEE -> "".
EEABEEEE can be derived from FABFF using rule 1 twice, but not directly.
FABFF -> EEABEEF -> EEABEEEE.

It seems like we can't create the "AC" at the beginning of "EEABEEEE".
Therefore, it is impossible to solve this problem.

However, we are told that every problem is solvable. I must be missing something.
