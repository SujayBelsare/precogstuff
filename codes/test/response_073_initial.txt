Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully.

Initial string: "3A0FD2EF"
Goal: ""
Transitions:
1) "0FD"->"89"
2) "EF"->"2B"
3) "A8922B"->"4F6AAE"
4) "3"->"337"
5) ""->"0C"
6) "0C0C3374F6AAE"->""

First, I apply rule 4 to the initial string:
"3A0FD2EF" -> "337A0FD2EF"

Next, I apply rule 1 to the string:
"337A0FD2EF" -> "337A892EF"

Next, I apply rule 2 to the string:
"337A892EF" -> "337A8922B"

Next, I apply rule 3 to the string:
"337A8922B" -> "3374F6AAE"

Now the string is "3374F6AAE". I need to somehow introduce "0C0C" at the beginning. Rule 5 allows me to insert "0C" into an empty string. This won't help directly. However, let's re-examine the target string for rule 6: "0C0C3374F6AAE".

Let's try to work backward from the target of rule 6.
"0C0C3374F6AAE" -> ""
We need to get "0C0C3374F6AAE". We have "3374F6AAE". So we need to introduce "0C0C" at the beginning. There is no rule to add to the beginning.

Let's rethink the initial steps.
"3A0FD2EF"
Apply rule 1: "3A0FD2EF" -> "3A892EF"
Apply rule 2: "3A892EF" -> "3A8922B"

Now, we have "3A8922B". I'm trying to get to "0C0C3374F6AAE".
Apply rule 4: "3A8922B" -> "337A8922B"

Now, we have "337A8922B".
Apply rule 3: "337A8922B" -> "3374F6AAE"

Now, we have "3374F6AAE".
We need to introduce "0C0C" at the beginning. We can't.

Let's try a different start.
"3A0FD2EF"

Apply rule 4: "3A0FD2EF" -> "337A0FD2EF"
Apply rule 1: "337A0FD2EF" -> "337A892EF"
Apply rule 2: "337A892EF" -> "337A8922B"
Apply rule 3: "337A8922B" -> "3374F6AAE"

We have "3374F6AAE". We need "0C0C".

I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach.

"3A0FD2EF"
Apply rule 1: "3A0FD2EF" -> "3A892EF"
Apply rule 2: "3A892EF" -> "3A8922B"
Apply rule 4: "3A8922B" -> "337A8922B"
Apply rule 3: "337A8922B" -> "3374F6AAE"

Still stuck.

I need to introduce "0C0C" somehow. The only way is through rule 5: ""->"0C". But that won't help connect to the rest of the string.

"JW HELP!"
