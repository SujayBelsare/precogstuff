The initial string is "AFCAE". The goal is to transform it into "".
Available transitions:
1) ""->"BC"
2) "BCBCBCBCAFCAE"->""

It seems impossible to directly reduce "AFCAE" to an empty string using the available transitions. The only way to get rid of it is to have "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
Since rule 1 adds "BC" to the string, we need to find a way to insert "BCBCBCBCAF" before "CAE".
We need to transform "AFCAE" into "BCBCBCBCAFCAE". Then we apply rule 2.

Let's analyze the difference between the initial string "AFCAE" and the target string "BCBCBCBCAFCAE".
We need to add "BCBCBCBC" before "AFCAE". This cannot be done because Rule 1 adds "BC" *after* the current string, not before.
