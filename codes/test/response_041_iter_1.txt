Okay, I was missing something crucial. I need to ensure I am using all the possible transitions at each step. Let's re-examine the problem.

Initial string: BFCCA

Available transitions:
1) "CA"->"FD"
2) "FD"->"FB"
3) "B"->"FE"
4) "EFCF"->"DC"
5) "FDCFE"->""

BFCCA

1. Apply rule 1 "CA"->"FD": BFCCA -> BFFD
2. Apply rule 3 "B"->"FE": BFFD -> FEFFD
3. Apply rule 2 "FD"->"FB": FEFFD -> FEFFB
4. Apply rule 3 "B"->"FE": FEFFB -> FEFFE. This doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

Let's start with "B"->"FE" first.

BFCCA
1. Apply rule 3 "B"->"FE": BFCCA -> FECCA
2. Apply rule 1 "CA"->"FD": FECCA -> FEFD
3. Apply rule 2 "FD"->"FB": FEFD -> FEFB

Still, it's not clear how to reach "FDCFE".

Let's analyze the target "FDCFE".
We can get "DC" from "EFCF" (rule 4). So, we need to somehow create "EFCF" inside the string.

Let's try a different route. Let's try to create an "EFCF" sequence.

BFCCA
1. Apply rule 3 to B: FECCA
2. Apply rule 1 to CA: FEFD
3. Apply rule 2 to FD: FEFB. Not helping.

Let's try to delay using rule 3 for as long as possible.

BFCCA
1. Rule 1: BFCCA -> BFFD
Now we need to get to FDCFE. Let's see if there is a way to manipulate BFFD.

Let's think step by step. We want to end with FDCFE.
Before that, we want EFCF.
Before that, we have a bunch of options.

BFCCA
1. Apply rule 1: BFCCA -> BFFD
2. Apply rule 3 to B: FEFFD
3. Apply rule 2 to FD: FEFFB
4. Apply rule 3 to B: FEFFE. This is going nowhere.

If we apply rule 3 first:
BFCCA
1. Apply rule 3 to B: FECCA
2. Apply rule 1 to CA: FEFD
3. Apply rule 2 to FD: FEFB.

Let's think outside the box.

BFCCA
1. Apply rule 1: BFCCA -> BFFD
2. Apply rule 3 to first B: FEFFD
3. Apply rule 2 to FD: FEFFB
4. Apply rule 3 to second B: FEFFE.

Let's try a different approach. We need 'FDCFE'. 'DC' comes from 'EFCF'. Let's aim for that.

BFCCA
1. B -> FE : FECCA
2. CA -> FD: FEFD
3. FD -> FB: FEFB

Still not seeing it.

BFCCA
1. B -> FE : FECCA
2. CA -> FD : FEFD
3. FD -> FB : FEFB

Let's think about "FDCFE".
We need to create "FDCFE".

BFCCA -> BFFD (Rule 1)
BFFD -> FEFFD (Rule 3)
FEFFD -> FEFFB (Rule 2)

Let's try another way.

BFCCA.
We want FDCFE.

BFCCA -> FECCA (Rule 3)
FECCA -> FEFD (Rule 1)
FEFD -> FEFB (Rule 2)

I'm still missing something.

BFCCA
Rule 1: BFFD
Rule 2: BFFB
Rule 3: FEFFB

Let's write down the rules again:
1) "CA"->"FD"
2) "FD"->"FB"
3) "B"->"FE"
4) "EFCF"->"DC"
5) "FDCFE"->""

BFCCA -> BFFD (1)
BFFD -> FEFFD (3)
FEFFD -> FEFFB (2)
FEFFB -> FEFFE (3)

Okay, I think I have a breakthrough.

BFCCA
1. B -> FE: FECCA
2. CA -> FD: FEFD
3. FD -> FB: FEFB

No.

BFCCA
1. CA -> FD: BFFD
2. B -> FE: FEFFD
3. FD -> FB: FEFFB

Let me try to make EFCF.
BFCCA
1. CA -> FD: BFFD
2. B -> FE: FEFFD
3. FD -> FB: FEFFB.

It is still unclear.

Let's try backward reasoning.
FDCFE -> ""
EFCF -> DC

BFCCA
1. B -> FE: FECCA
2. CA -> FD: FEFD
3. FD -> FB: FEFB

I need to find a path.

Okay, let's try this:

BFCCA
1. CA -> FD: BFFD
2. FD -> FB: BFFB
3. B -> FE: FEFFB

Not helping.

BFCCA
1. B -> FE: FECCA
2. CA -> FD: FEFD

Not helping.
