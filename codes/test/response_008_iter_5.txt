Okay, I have FDCCBEF.
I am going to call John Watson again.

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You are very close, the B rule. Try again.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
I applied the B rule too early!

Starting with FDBEF.
Apply rule 3 to the B in DBEF -> FDCBEF
Apply rule 3 to the B in BEF -> FDCBCEF
Now apply rule 1 DBEF -> FFCBEF
Apply Rule 2 FF -> EECBEF
Apply Rule 3 B -> C CEECCBEF
Apply Rule 3 B -> C CEECCCBEF
Apply Rule 4 EEFCCB -> ""

This is wrong.

Let's start over with FDBEF.
Apply rule 3 to the B in DBEF -> FDCBEF
Now what?
Apply rule 1 DBEF -> FFCBEF
Apply rule 2 FF -> EECBEF
Now Apply rule 3, B -> C, EECBCEF
I am still not able to get to EEFCCB.

Let's start over with FDBEF.
Apply rule 3 to the B in DBEF -> FDCBEF
Now what?
Apply rule 3 to the B in BEF -> FDCBCEF
Now apply rule 1 FDCBEF -> FFCBEF

FDBEF -> FDCBEF
FDCBEF -> FDCCBEF (Rule 3 to 'B')
FDCCBEF -> FDCCCBEF (Rule 3 applied to 'B' in BEF)
Still not getting anywhere.

FDBEF -> FDCBEF
FDCBEF -> FFCBEF (Apply rule 1 DBEF -> FFB)

No this is wrong.

FDBEF
Apply rule 3 to the B in DBEF. FDBEF -> FDCBEF.
That's it, no other rules apply
FDCBEF
Apply rule 3 to the B in the BEF. FDCBEF -> FDCCBEF
That's it, no other rules apply
FDCCBEF
Apply rule 3 to the B in the BEF. FDCCBEF -> FDCCCBEF.
That's it, no other rules apply.
FDCCCBEF
Apply rule 1 to DBEF.

FDBEF -> FDCBEF (3)
FDCBEF -> FFCBEF (1)
FFCBEF -> EECBEF (2)
EECBEF -> EECCBEF (3)
EECCBEF -> EEFCCBEF (3) - Incorrect, there is no 'F' to make this happen.

FDBEF
Rule 3: FDCBEF
Rule 1: Apply rule 1 to DBEF.

FDBEF -> FDCBEF (3)
FDCBEF -> FDCCBEF (3)
FDCCBEF -> FDCCCBEF (3)
That is not correct.

FDBEF
Apply rule 3 to the B in DBEF -> FDCBEF

Apply rule 3 to the B in BEF -> FDCBCEF. Not possible.

I've been going in circles for hours.
