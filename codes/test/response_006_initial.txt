Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The goal is to transform "BCCBDDEC" into an empty string using the given transitions:

1) "DD"->"EF"
2) ""->"DC"
3) "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC"->""

The initial string is "BCCBDDEC". It seems difficult to directly apply transition 3 to the initial string. Transition 2 is interesting as it can insert "DC" anywhere. Transition 1 can transform "DD" to "EF". Let's see if we can manipulate the initial string to form "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC".

Initial string: "BCCBDDEC"

1. Apply transition 1: "BCCBDDEC" -> "BCCBDEFEC"
Now we have "EFEC" at the end, which is part of the target string. We also have "BCCB" which is also part of the target string. So we need to add "DCDCDCB".

It seems impossible to create "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC" from "BCCBDEFEC". The only way to add characters is transition 2, but it adds "DC" and not "DCDCDCB".

Let me try a different approach. If we could somehow get "DCDCDCBCCBEFEC" directly from "BCCBDDEC", then that would be great, but that seems impossible.
