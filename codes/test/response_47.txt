Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game for the given problem.

**Initial String:** "CFACDBCC"

**Available Transitions:**
1) "CDBCC"->"AA"
2) "AA"->"FD"
3) "FF"->"BD"
4) "BD"->"BF"
5) "A"->"BB"
6) "CBFDBB"->""

**Reasoning:**

1. **CFACDBCC -> CFAAA** (Apply rule 1 to "CDBCC")
2. **CFAAA -> CFFD** (Apply rule 2 to "AA")
3. **CFFD -> CBDD** (Apply rule 3 to "FF")
4. **CBDD -> CBFD** (Apply rule 4 to "BD")
5. **CBFD -> CBFDBF** (Apply rule 5 to "D")
6. **CBFDBF-> CBFDBB** (Apply rule 5 to "F")
7. **CBFDBB-> ""** (Apply rule 6 to "CBFDBB")

**Solution:**

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
