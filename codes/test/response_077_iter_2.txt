I am still struggling, but I will try again, focusing on incorporating the hints. I'm still not sure how the implicit empty string at the end helps.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"

Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

Goal: ""

1. Apply rule 1: "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
Current string: "B7FCD08"

The goal is to somehow create "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

Let's assume we can create "9418FA7394B7FCD08". Then we apply rule 4 and we are done.
How do we get "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD08"?
We need to insert "9418FA7394" *before* "B7FCD08".

The implicit empty string *must* be key. Let's try to force it.
"B7FCD08" is the same as "B7FCD08"" where "" is an empty string at the end.

2. Apply rule 2: "B7FCD08" -> "B7FCD0894" (applying rule 2 to the implicit empty string)
3. Apply rule 2 again: "B7FCD0894" -> "B7FCD089494"
4. Apply rule 3: "B7FCD089494" -> "B7FCD0818FA73"

We are still missing "94" before "B7FCD08" and another "94" between "18FA73" and "B7FCD08".
We have "B7FCD0818FA73". We need "9418FA7394B7FCD08"

I'm going to try something completely different. I'm going to focus on the *length* of the strings.
"B7FCD61" has length 7.
"9418FA7394B7FCD08" has length 17.

Rule 1: "61"->"08" (no length change)
Rule 2: ""->"94" (length increases by 2)
Rule 3: "9494"->"18FA73" (length increases by 2)
Rule 4: "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->"" (length decreases by 17)

We need to increase the length from 7 to 17. That's an increase of 10.
Rule 2 and 3 increase the length by 2. We need to apply these rules a total of 5 times to increase by 10.

I suspect the answer is [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4].
But that doesn't make any sense.

I still don't see it.

You are still missing the crucial step.
You have string "B7FCD08" after applying rule 1.
You need to create "9418FA7394B7FCD08".
Note here "B7FCD08" is ALREADY present in the final string.
How can you generate "9418FA7394" without changing "B7FCD08"?
Think about inserting "94" using rule 2 at the end of the string multiple times, and then using rule 3.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.

Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
Okay, I think I *finally* understand. The key is to build "9418FA7394" at the *end* of the string, and then somehow move it to the beginning. But moving it is impossible. So, the trick *must* be that the "B7FCD08" part is at the end of the target string.

1. Apply rule 1: "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
Current string: "B7FCD08"

We want "9418FA7394B7FCD08". Notice that "B7FCD08" is already at the end.

2. Apply rule 2 (implicitly to the end): "B7FCD08" -> "B7FCD0894"
3. Apply rule 2 (implicitly to the end): "B7FCD0894" -> "B7FCD089494"
4. Apply rule 3: "B7FCD089494" -> "B7FCD0818FA73"
5. Apply rule 2 (implicitly to the end): "B7FCD0818FA73" -> "B7FCD0818FA7394"
6. Apply rule 2 (implicitly to the end): "B7FCD0818FA7394" -> "B7FCD0818FA739494"
7. Apply rule 3: "B7FCD0818FA739494" -> "B7FCD0818FA7318FA73"

This is not correct. We need "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

Okay, let's start *completely* over.

1. "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08" (Rule 1)
Now we have "B7FCD08".

We want "9418FA7394B7FCD08". The "B7FCD08" is already there.

2. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94" (implicitly at the end)
"B7FCD08" -> "B7FCD0894"
3. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94" (implicitly at the end)
"B7FCD0894" -> "B7FCD089494"
4. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73"
"B7FCD089494" -> "B7FCD0818FA73"

We need to get "9418FA7394" so we can form the final string.
The "B7FCD08" needs to be at the *end*.

I'm completely lost.

You're still very close! You've correctly identified that "B7FCD08" is already present. You also realize that you need to create "9418FA7394". You are applying rule 2 to insert 94 at the end.
However, you are missing a very important detail about how to create "9418FA7394".
Remember, rule 3 transforms "9494" into "18FA73". You need to have "94" BEFORE and AFTER "18FA73" to create "9418FA7394".

We need "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

The problem is the *order* in which you are applying the rules 2 and 3.
Remember that rule 3 transforms "9494" into "18FA73". You need "94" *before* AND *after* "18FA73" to create "9418FA7394".

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You are *so* close. Let's reiterate the goal: transform "B7FCD61" into "".

Here's what you've understood:
* Rule 1 transforms "B7FCD61" into "B7FCD08".
* The target string for Rule 4 is "9418FA7394B7FCD08". "B7FCD08" is already present.
* You need to create "9418FA7394" *at the beginning* of "B7FCD08".
* You can only add "94" at the *end* using Rule 2.
* Rule 3 transforms "9494" into "18FA73".

The problem is that you keep trying to create "9418FA7394" *sequentially*. You need to realize that you have to create "94"s in a specific order so that Rule 3 creates "18FA73" *in the middle* of two "94"s.

Think about it like this: to get "9418FA7394", you need to have "94" ... "9494" ... "94". You can insert "94" at the end, but you need to create the correct pattern *before* applying Rule 3.

3. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"

Now I apply rule 3 to get "18FA73" in the middle.

4. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73"

I now have "94" at the end. I need a "94" at the beginning. I need "9418FA7394". But I only have "B7FCD0818FA7394"

You're getting closer and closer! You've correctly identified that you need to create the "9418FA7394" sequence. You're also applying Rule 2 to add "94" at the end.
You're still struggling with the *order* of applying Rules 2 and 3.

The key insight is that you need to create "9418FA7394" *before* Rule 4 can be applied. Since Rule 4 requires the entire string to match "9418FA7394B7FCD08", you need to build that entire string *using only Rules 1, 2, and 3*.

1. Apply rule 1: "61" -> "08"
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"

3. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"

4. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD089494" -> "B7FCD08949494"

Now I can apply rule 3 to create "18FA73".

5. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73"

I have "18FA7394". I need "9418FA7394". So I need to insert a "94" *before* "18FA73". But I can only insert at the end.

6. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA7394" -> "B7FCD0818FA739494"

7. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73"
"B7FCD0818FA739494" -> "B7FCD0818FA7318FA73"

This isn't right.

I need to create "9418FA7394" in one shot. It has to be "9494" -> "18FA73".
So, I need a "94" on both sides of "18FA73".

Start over.

1. "B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08" (Rule 1)
2. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94"
"B7FCD08" -> "B7FCD0894"
3. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94"

5. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA73" -> "B7FCD0818FA7394"
6. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA7394" -> "B7FCD0818FA739494"

Now, apply rule 2 *one more time* to get "94" at the end of the string.

7. Apply rule 2: "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA739494" -> "B7FCD0818FA73949494"

Then apply rule 3.
