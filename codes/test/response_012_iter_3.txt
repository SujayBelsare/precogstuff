Okay, John Watson is telling me to apply transition 1 before transition 3.

Initial string: CBBEC
Available transitions:
1) "BEC"->"CD"
2) "BC"->"BB"
3) "CBB"->"EEF"
4) "FD"->"ED"
5) "EEED"->""

CBBEC
Apply rule 1: BEC -> CD
CBBEC -> CBBCD

Now we have CBBCD.

We want to get to EEED.

Apply rule 3 is not applicable.
Apply rule 2: BC -> BB
CBBCD. BC is applicable.
CBBCD -> CBBBD

Now we have CBBBD.

Apply rule 3: CBB -> EEF
CBBBD -> EEFBD

Now we have EEFBD.
This doesn't seem right.

Let's go back to CBBCD.

CBBCD
Apply rule 2: BC -> BB
CBBCD -> CBBBD

Apply rule 3: CBB -> EEF
CBBBD -> EEFBD

EEFBD.

I'm not sure what to do.

Let's try rule 1 first, then rule 2:
CBBEC -> CBBCD
CBBCD -> CBBBD
CBBBD -> EEFBD.

Maybe I should apply rule 2 *before* rule 1.

CBBEC.
Apply rule 2: BC -> BB is not applicable.
Apply rule 3: CBB -> EEF
CBBEC -> EEFEC

EEFEC.
This doesn't seem right.

Let's try going back to the basics.
CBBEC.
We want to get to EEED.

Let's try applying rule 1 first.
CBBEC -> CBBCD.
Then apply rule 2.
CBBCD -> CBBBD.
Then apply rule 3.
CBBBD -> EEFBD.

EEFBD.

Let's try a different approach.

CBBEC.

Apply rule 2 is not applicable.
Apply rule 3: CBB -> EEF
CBBEC -> EEFEC.

EEFEC.
Now what?

Sometimes it helps to focus on a single character that needs to be eliminated or transformed.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).

Can you identify a transition that creates a pattern that another transition can then use?
