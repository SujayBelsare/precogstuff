Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "FFADA"
Available transitions:
1) "A"->"AF"
2) "FFAFFFFDA"->""

We need to reach an empty string. Let's try applying transition 1 to "A" in "FFADA".

FFADA -> FFAFDA

Applying transition 1 again:

FFAFDA -> FFAFFDA

Applying transition 1 again:

FFAFFDA -> FFAFFFDA

Applying transition 1 again:

FFAFFFDA -> FFAFFFFDA

Applying transition 1 again:

FFAFFFFDA -> FFAFFFFFDA

This seems to be making the string longer with "F"s, and we need to get rid of them. Transition 2 seems like the only way to do that, but it requires a specific pattern "FFAFFFFDA".

Let's start again from the initial string: "FFADA". Can we insert the right number of F's to match transition 2's requirements? We could try to use transition 1 strategically.

FFADA -> Apply rule 1 to "A" to get: FFAFDA
FFAFDA -> Apply rule 1 to "A" to get: FFAFFDA
FFAFFDA -> Apply rule 1 to "A" to get: FFAFFFDA
FFAFFFDA -> Apply rule 1 to "A" to get: FFAFFFFDA
FFAFFFFDA -> Apply rule 1 to "A" to get: FFAFFFFFDA. We only need one more A.

Consider another approach. Rule 2 is "FFAFFFFDA" -> "". The current string is FFADA. We need to transform FFADA to FFAFFFFDA.
FFADA -> FFAFDA (rule 1)
FFAFDA -> FFAFFDA (rule 1)
FFAFFDA -> FFAFFFDA (rule 1)
FFAFFFDA -> FFAFFFFDA (rule 1)
Now we have FFAFFFFDA and we can apply rule 2.

So the sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1, 2].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}$
