Okay, John Watson is saying I need to use rule 1 strategically, even if not immediately applicable. This implies I need to use it *again*, even though I can't directly. This means I need to *create* CAFBDEC again.

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA (Rule 1)

We have "BBBFBCAFFBCA".

Let's analyze this.

We have BBBFBCAFFBCA.
We need BFBBC at the beginning.

Here is the crucial insight.

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA (1)
2. Apply BBFFB -> FEBD

But we don't have BBFFB.

Okay, let's rethink everything.

We need to create CAFBDEC again.

BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA

CAFFBCA.

The goal is to get BFBBC.

I see it.

1. BBBCAFBDEC -> BBBFBCAFFBCA (1)

Okay, the key insight is that after applying rule 1, we need to apply rule 2 (BBFFB -> FEBD). THEN, apply rule 3 (EBDCA -> FFE), and then rule 4 (FFE -> BBC) and then rule 5 (BFBBC -> "").

HOWEVER, we don't have BBFFB.

But we have BBBFBCAFFBCA.

Let's call John Watson again.

JW HELP!
