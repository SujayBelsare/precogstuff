Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "EBDDB", and the goal is to reach an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) ""->"BF"
2) "BFBFBFBFEBDDB"->""

Since transition 1 adds "BF" and transition 2 removes "BFBFBFBFEBDDB", we must somehow create "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" from "EBDDB". However, transition 1 can only add at the end if the string is empty, which is not the case.

The only applicable transition to begin with is transition 2, but it requires an exact match of "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". The initial string is "EBDDB" which doesn't contain that pattern. Transition 1 can't be used yet.

Since we must end with an empty string, we want to reach "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". We start with "EBDDB". It seems impossible to reach "BFBFBFBFEBDDB" starting from "EBDDB" using these transitions.

There must be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I am missing something very subtle. Given the constraints, there is no way to transform "EBDDB" into "" using only the provided transitions. Transition 1 requires the string to be empty and adds "BF", which can never lead to "BFBFBFBFEBDDB". Transition 2 can only be applied if the string is exactly "BFBFBFBFEBDDB", which cannot be achieved starting from "EBDDB".

Therefore, there is no solution possible with the given transitions and initial string to the empty string. Because there is no applicable transition sequence, the answer is an empty list which means the input initial string is already the final string, which is a contradiction.
