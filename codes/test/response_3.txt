Okay, I understand the Sed Puzzle Game rules. I will start with "EBBAD" and apply transitions to reach an empty string. I must provide the list of transitions I use. Let's begin.

1.  **EBBAD**:  I can apply transition 1 ("D"->"BF") to the rightmost 'D'. This gives me "EBBABF".

2.  **EBBABF**: I see "BB", so I can use transition 3 ("BB"->"AE") at the beginning to get "EAEABF".

3. **EAEABF**: I can use transition 2 ("F"->"AE") to the rightmost 'F'. This gives me "EAEABAE".

4.  **EAEABAE**: I can use transition 2 ("F"->"AE") to the rightmost 'F'. This gives me "EAEABAE". I made a mistake in step 3, transition 2 should have transformed "EAEABF" into "EAEABAE". 

5.  **EAEABAE**: Let's apply transition 4 ("BA"->"CF") to transform "EAEABAE" into "EAEACFE".

6.  **EAEACFE**:  Now I can apply transition 5 ("EAEACFE"->"") to get "".

Therefore, the correct sequence is [1, 3, 2, 4, 5].

```
[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
