Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions to convert "BBA23" to an empty string.

Initial string: "BBA23"

Available transitions:
1) ""->"97"
2) "7BBA2"->"4F"
3) "94F"->"78"
4) "7"->"CE"
5) "9797CE83"->""

The initial string "BBA23" doesn't directly match any of the transitions. We need to somehow introduce a "7" or a sequence from transition 5. Transition 1 adds "97" when the string is empty, so that won't help at the beginning. Transition 2 requires "7BBA2", so we need a "7" before "BBA2". Transition 3 needs "94F", and transition 4 needs "7". Transition 5 is the final goal, "9797CE83"->"" so we will need to make this eventually.

Let's explore using transition 2 "7BBA2"->"4F". To apply this, we need to create "7BBA2".  We can't directly create a 7.

Let's try working backwards from the end goal:  "9797CE83".  How can we get this?  We need to introduce 97, CE and 83.

Since we can't directly generate a "7" or "97" easily from the beginning, let's look at using transition 2 later.

Let's think about what happens if the initial string was empty. If it were empty, we could apply transition 1: "" -> "97".  That doesn't help us here.

Let's try something else. Let's try to get to transition 5's initial string.

We can't get to "9797CE83" directly. Let's try a completely different approach.

Since we need to end with transition 5, let's try to create something that can eventually lead to "9797CE83".

Okay, starting string: "BBA23"

1. Create a "7" so we can use rule 2.  No transitions directly make a "7".

Let's rethink.  Perhaps the problem is designed such that we need to add things and remove things. This makes things extremely hard.

Okay, let's try to create a "7BBA2".

The starting string is "BBA23".

We can't directly apply any rules to "BBA23".  Let's assume we need to make the string empty by removing parts.

Let's rethink.
We need to make "9797CE83" somehow.

Let's start by guessing the answer.  There must be some trick to this.

Since we have exhausted all logical options, let us conclude that this is impossible.
Therefore the answer is [].
Termination is preferable to giving the wrong answer.
