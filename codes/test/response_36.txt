Okay, let's analyze the problem and find the correct sequence of transitions.

Initial string: "DBFFA"
Available transitions:
1) "DBFF"->"DFF"
2) ""->"EF"
3) "EFEFEFEFDFFA"->""

We want to reach an empty string. Transition 3 is a terminal transition, meaning that if we can get the string into "EFEFEFEFDFFA" we can solve the problem. Transitions 1 and 2 could be used to reach "EFEFEFEFDFFA". Let's see.

"DBFFA"

Transition 1 cannot be applied. Transition 2 cannot be applied. Transition 3 cannot be applied.

Since transition 2 adds "EF" to an empty string, it can not be useful here.

So, let's try to think backwards from "EFEFEFEFDFFA". We need to somehow get the initial string to be "EFEFEFEFDFFA". It does not appear possible to reach the final string.

Let's look again at the string "DBFFA". It looks like it is impossible to remove that "A" from the end.

If we apply transition 1, we get "DFFFA".
Since transition 2 can only be used for the empty string, then there is no use.

If we have "DFFFA", we'd need "EFEFEFEFDFFA" to work. Since DFFFA cannot be converted to "EFEFEFEFDFFA", we have no options.

Therefore, it is impossible to get to the empty string. There must be an error in the problem statement, or a typo.

Since the problem states that it *is* solvable, I must consider the possibility that an empty string can be formed without actually using transition 3. Since the problem says there *is* a solution, and I can not get to an empty string, then there must be a trick that I am not seeing. Transition 2 is only applicable to the empty string.

It is impossible to go from "DBFFA" to an empty string using these transitions.

Because I am told there is a solution, there must be a trick that I am missing. If I could add "EF" to the end, I could keep adding it until I get "EFEFEFEFDFFA".
I must re-read the rules.

The rules state that the transitions are applicable only in one direction. Also, only the *first* matching substring is modified.

The problem must have a typo. It is not possible to convert "DBFFA" into "".
Final Answer: The correct answer is that this problem is not solvable with these transitions. There must be an error in the problem.
