Okay, let's focus on how to use the "A" effectively, as John Watson suggested. The only rule that directly involves "A" is Rule 5: "A"->"BB". We need to strategically place "BB" in a way that leads to "CBFDBB".

Initial string: "CFACDBCC"

1. Apply Rule 5 to the "A": "A"->"BB"
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

Now we have "CFBBCDBCC". Notice "CDBCC" which can be simplified using Rule 1.

2. Apply Rule 1: "CDBCC"->"AA"
CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

Now we have "CFBBAA". Let's apply Rule 5 again to both A's:

3. Apply Rule 5 to the first "A": "A"->"BB"
CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

This doesn't seem right. Let's go back to CFBBAA and apply rule 5 only to second A
CFBBAA -> CFABBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

Now what?

CFACDBCC

1. Rule 5 to A: A -> BB
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

2. Rule 1: CDBCC -> AA
CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

3. Rule 2: AA -> FD
CFBBAA -> CFBFD

We are closer! Now we just need to get "CBFDBB". We have "CFBFD".

CFACDBCC

1. Rule 5 to A: A -> BB
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

2. Rule 1: CDBCC -> AA
CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

3. Rule 2: AA -> FD
CFBBAA -> CFBFD

4. Rule 4: BD -> BF, not applicable.
5. Rule 3: FF -> BD, not applicable.

Let's rethink. The target is CBFDBB.

CFACDBCC

1. Rule 1: CDBCC -> AA
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA

2. Rule 5: A -> BB
CFAAA -> CFBBA

3. Rule 5: A -> BB
CFBBA -> CFBBBB

That doesn't work.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

2. Rule 1: CDBCC -> AA
CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

Here, we want CBFDBB.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 1: CDBCC -> AA
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA
2. Rule 5: CFAAA -> CFBBA
3. Rule 5: CFBBA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

We have CFBBAA

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

This does not work.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

What can we do?

Let's try again.
CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 2: AA -> FD
CFBBAA -> CFBFD

This is not working.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

I keep looping in the same spot.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Apply rule 5 to other A: CFBBAA -> CFABBB

No.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

The goal is CBFDBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 1: CFACDBCC -> CFAAA
2. Rule 5: CFAAA -> CFBBA

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 2: CFBBAA -> CFBFD

CFACDBCC

1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Apply Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Apply Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Apply Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB
4. Apply Rule 3: FF->BD (Not applicable)
5. Apply Rule 4: BD->BF (Not applicable)

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 1: CFACDBCC -> CFAAA
2. Rule 5: CFAAA -> CFBBA

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

I am stuck.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 2: CFBBAA -> CFBFD

Let's try a different approach.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

CBFDBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 2: CFBBAA -> CFBFD
4. Rule 3: CFBFD -> (Not applicable)
5. Rule 4: CFBFD -> (Not applicable)

I need to use rule 6
CBFDBB

CFACDBCC
1. Apply Rule 1: CFACDBCC -> CFAAA
2. Apply Rule 5: CFAAA -> CFBBA
3. Apply Rule 5: CFBBA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Apply Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Apply Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Apply Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

This is not working.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 2: CFBBAA -> CFBFD

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

CBFDBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

I am trapped in a loop.

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

I need to get to CBFDBB
CFACDBCC

1. Apply Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Apply Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA
3. Apply Rule 5: CFBBAA -> CFBBBB

CFACDBCC
1. Apply Rule 5: CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC
2. Apply Rule 1: CFBBCDBCC -> CFBBAA

I give up for now.
