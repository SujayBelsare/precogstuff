Okay, let's solve the Sed Puzzle Game. The initial string is "16323E51", and the available transitions are:

1) "3"->"A3"
2) "23E"->"C1"
3) "A"->"A1"
4) "151"->"976CC"
5) "13"->"AA"
6) "16A1AAC976CC"->""

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Apply transition 1:** "16323E51" -> "16A323E51"  (Replaces the first "3" with "A3")
2. **Apply transition 2:** "16A323E51" -> "16A3C151" (Replaces "23E" with "C1")
3. **Apply transition 1:** "16A3C151" -> "16AA3C151" (Replaces the first "3" with "A3")
4. **Apply transition 1:** "16AA3C151" -> "16AAA3C151" (Replaces the first "3" with "A3")
5. **Apply transition 3:** "16AAA3C151" -> "16AAA1A3C151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
6. **Apply transition 3:** "16AAA1A3C151" -> "16AA1AA3C151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
7. **Apply transition 3:** "16AA1AA3C151" -> "16A1AAA3C151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
8. **Apply transition 5:** "16A1AAA3C151" -> "16A1AAAAC151" (Replaces "13" with "AA")
9. **Apply transition 3:** "16A1AAAAC151" -> "16A1AA1AAC151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
10. **Apply transition 3:** "16A1AA1AAC151" -> "16A1A1AAC151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
11. **Apply transition 3:** "16A1A1AAC151" -> "16A1A1A1AC151" (Replaces the first "A" with "A1")
12. **Apply transition 4:** "16A1A1A1AC151" -> "16A1A1A1AC976CC" (Replaces "151" with "976CC")
13. **Apply transition 6:** "16A1A1A1AC976CC" -> "" (Replaces "16A1A1A1AC976CC" with "")

Therefore, the solution is:

[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6]
