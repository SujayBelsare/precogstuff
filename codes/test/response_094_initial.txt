Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "9C48701F4" and the goal is to reduce it to "". We have seven transitions available.

Initial string: "9C48701F4"

Let's try applying the transitions one by one and see if we can find a path to the empty string.

1) "01"->"7A0"
2) "77A0F"->"487774A"
3) "4848"->"AB"
4) "9C"->"FD"
5) "7774"->"A28C4"
6) "28C"->"48374"
7) "FDABA483744A4"->""

First, let's apply transition 4 to "9C48701F4":
"9C48701F4" -> "FD48701F4"  [4]

Now we have "FD48701F4". Let's try applying transition 1 to "01" in "FD48701F4":
"FD48701F4" -> "FD4877A0F4" [1]

Now we have "FD4877A0F4". Now, let's look for "77A0F". Applying transition 2:
"FD4877A0F4" -> "FD48487774A4" [2]

Now we have "FD48487774A4". Let's apply transition 3 to "4848":
"FD48487774A4" -> "FDAB7774A4" [3]

Now we have "FDAB7774A4". Let's apply transition 5 to "7774":
"FDAB7774A4" -> "FDA28C4A4" [5]

Now we have "FDA28C4A4". Let's apply transition 6 to "28C":
"FDA28C4A4" -> "FDA483744A4" [6]

Now we have "FDA483744A4". Transition 7 is "FDABA483744A4"->""
So, we need to create "FDABA483744A4". We have "FDA483744A4".

Let's go back to [3].
"FD48487774A4" -> "FDAB7774A4" [3]

Now we have "FDAB7774A4". Apply transition 5:
"FDAB7774A4" -> "FDABA28C4A4" [5]

Now we have "FDABA28C4A4". Apply transition 6:
"FDABA28C4A4" -> "FDABA483744A4" [6]

Now we have "FDABA483744A4". Apply transition 7:
"FDABA483744A4" -> "" [7]

Solution: [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]}$
