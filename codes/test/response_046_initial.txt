Let's analyze the problem and find a sequence of transitions to convert "CFACDBCC" to "".

Initial string: "CFACDBCC"

Available transitions:
1) "CDBCC"->"AA"
2) "AA"->"FD"
3) "FF"->"BD"
4) "BD"->"BF"
5) "A"->"BB"
6) "CBFDBB"->""

CFACDBCC

First, let's try applying rule 1:
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA

Now, apply rule 2:
CFAAA -> CFFD

Apply rule 3:
CFFD -> CBDD

Apply rule 4:
CBDD -> CBFD

Now we need to somehow create "CBFDBB". Let's explore other paths. Instead of starting with rule 1, let's see what happens if we apply rule 5 to the initial string:
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

This doesn't seem promising. Let's go back to our original path.

CFA AA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD

If we could get a "BB" on the end, we could use rule 6.

Let's re-examine our initial transformation from CFACDBCC -> CFAAA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD

Let's backtrack to CFAAA. What if we applied rule 5 to the second A?
CFAAA -> CFABB

This doesn't seem helpful. Let's try rule 5 to both AA:
CFAAA -> CFBBBB

Still doesn't seem helpful.

Back to the original path: CFACDBCC -> CFAAA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD. We want to get to CBFDBB.
Let's try to get the "BB" at the end. The only way to get "BB" is through rule 5.

How about applying rule 5 to the original string first:
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

This doesn't seem to help at all.

Let's go back to the original transformation:
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD.

We need a 'DBB' at the end.
Let's try to introduce rule 5 somewhere. Can we get A at the end?

Let's try to think backwards from CBFDBB.
To get CBFDBB, we need to apply rule 6.
So, we want CBFDBB. Before that, we might have had:
CBF(BD)B (rule 4 backwards)
CBF(FF)B (rule 3 backwards)
CBF(AA)B (rule 2 backwards)
CBF(CDBCC)B (rule 1 backwards)

The goal is to create CBFDBB. We have CFACDBCC.

Let's try something completely different. Let's use rule 5 right away.
CFACDBCC -> CFBBCDBCC

This is not helpful.

Let's go back to the original approach:
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD.

What if we apply rule 5 to A in CFAAA?
CFA AA -> CFABB
This does not help.

What if we apply rule 5 to the other A in CFAAA
CFA AA -> CFBBA

Still does not seem to help.

Let's go back to the original plan.
CFACDBCC -> CFAAA -> CFFD -> CBDD -> CBFD

We want to get to CBFDBB. The difference is the DD and BB.
If we had CBFDAA, we could apply rule 2 to get CFFFD and then rule 3 to get CBDD. But there is no way to make CBFDAA.

I think I am stuck.
JW HELP!
