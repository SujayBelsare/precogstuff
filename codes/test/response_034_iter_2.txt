Okay, John Watson is saying my reasoning about the empty string insertion is correct, but the order is slightly off. Let's re-examine the steps.

We start with "FABFF". We want to reach "".
The transitions are:
1) "F" -> "EE"
2) "" -> "AC"
3) "ACEEABEEEE" -> ""

The key is that rule 2 inserts "AC" at the beginning of the string.

1. Apply rule 2: "FABFF" becomes "ACFABFF".  [2]
2. Apply rule 1 to the first "F": "ACFABFF" becomes "ACEEABFF". [1]
3. Apply rule 1 to the second "F": "ACEEABFF" becomes "ACEEABEE". [1]

Now we have "ACEEABEE".

We need "ACEEABEEEE" to apply rule 3. We are missing two "EE"s.
We can only get "EE" by applying rule 1 to "F". But we don't have any "F"s left.

I made a mistake. Rule 2 is ""->"AC" and it inserts AC at the *beginning*.
So applying rule 2 to any string "S" gives "ACS".

Let's start with "FABFF".
Apply rule 1. "FABFF" -> "EEABEEF" [1]
Apply rule 1. "EEABEEF" -> "EEABEEEE" [1]
Apply rule 2. "EEABEEEE" -> "ACEEABEEEE" [2]
Apply rule 3. "ACEEABEEEE" -> "" [3]

So the sequence is [1, 1, 2, 3].

FINAL ANSWER: [1, 1, 2, 3]
STOP
