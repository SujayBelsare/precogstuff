Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "CBAB3801447" and the goal is to reach an empty string using the given transitions. The final transition, C01413EB1DCF -> "", suggests that we must somehow transform the initial string into "C01413EB1DCF". This is a good starting point.

Initial string: CBAB3801447

1) "44"->"D0"
2) "AB"->"41"
3) "7"->"D8"
4) "0D8"->"CF"
5) "80"->"EB"
6) "B"->"01"
7) "C01413EB1DCF"->""

Let's apply the transitions step by step, always aiming to get closer to "C01413EB1DCF".

1. CBAB3801447 -> C41B3801447  [2] (AB -> 41)
2. C41B3801447 -> C41013801447  [6] (B -> 01)
3. C41013801447 -> C41013EB1447 [5] (80 -> EB)
4. C41013EB1447 -> C41013EB14D07 [1] (44 -> D0)
5. C41013EB14D07 -> C41013EB14D0D8 [3] (7 -> D8)
6. C41013EB14D0D8 -> C41013EB14CF [4] (0D8 -> CF)
Now we have C41013EB14CF. We need to introduce "013" between "41" and "EB1".  Let's try converting 41 to something with a 0.
Unfortunately, we don't have a transition to convert "41". Let's start again and try a different order.

Initial string: CBAB3801447

1. CBAB3801447 -> CBAB38014D07 [1] (44 -> D0)
2. CBAB38014D07 -> CBAB38014D0D8 [3] (7 -> D8)
3. CBAB38014D0D8 -> CBAB38014CF [4] (0D8 -> CF)
4. CBAB38014CF -> C01AB38014CF [6] (B -> 01)
5. C01AB38014CF -> C014138014CF [2] (AB -> 41)
6. C014138014CF -> C01413EB14CF [5] (80 -> EB)

Now we have C01413EB14CF. We need to introduce D0, then D8.

7.  C01413EB14CF -> C01413EB144CF [1]  (NO! We're going backwards!)

Let's try a completely different approach.  Let's apply rule 6 as much as possible.

Initial string: CBAB3801447
1. CBAB3801447 -> C01AB3801447 [6]
2. C01AB3801447 -> C01413801447 [2]
3. C01413801447 -> C01413EB1447 [5]
4. C01413EB1447 -> C01413EB14D07 [1]
5. C01413EB14D07 -> C01413EB14D0D8 [3]
6. C01413EB14D0D8 -> C01413EB14CF [4]

Still stuck.
