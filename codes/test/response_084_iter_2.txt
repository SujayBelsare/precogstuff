Okay, John Watson's feedback is extremely helpful. I was tunnel-visioned on trying to use rule 2 early, but the question "Are you sure that applying the first transition is always the right choice when we start with a non-empty string?" makes me realize that starting with rule 1 is almost certainly wrong.

Let's revisit the initial string: "74865EC56AF" and the target string for rule 3: "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".

We have the transitions:
1) ""->"EC"
2) "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"->""

Let's try applying rule 2 *first*.  "74865EC56AF" becomes "74865E2044CF7E". Now, we need to prepend "ECECECECEC".  We cannot directly insert "EC" using rule 1 into the middle of "74865E2044CF7E".

However, the problem states that the initial string must be reduced to an empty string. Let's re-think the whole approach.

The final string before the empty string *must* be "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".  We have "74865EC56AF". Applying rule 2 gives "74865E2044CF7E". The goal is to obtain "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".

Let's consider this: We have "74865EC56AF". Rule 2 replaces "C56AF" with "2044CF7E". This transforms the string to "74865E2044CF7E".

Now we need to get "ECECECECEC" in front of "74865E2044CF7E". We can't use rule 1 to insert "EC" into the string.

I'm still missing a critical insight. Let's go back to the basics. We start with "74865EC56AF". The *only* thing we can directly act on is the "C56AF" at the end using Rule 2. This yields "74865E2044CF7E". Now we must somehow get "ECECECECEC" in front.

Here's the key. We *don't* insert. We *replace*. We have to view the initial string "74865EC56AF" and the final target "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" as connected *through* rule 2.

We apply rule 2 to get "74865E2044CF7E". Then, the *entire* string somehow becomes "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". But how?

I am still missing something fundamental.

Okay, let's try working backward from the goal. The goal is "". The step before the goal is "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" (rule 3). The step before that *must* lead to "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". We start with "74865EC56AF". Applying rule 2 gives us "74865E2044CF7E".

We need to transform "74865EC56AF" into "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". We know rule 2 transforms "C56AF" into "2044CF7E". So, we have:

"74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E" [2]

Now, we need "ECECECECEC" in front. There is *no way* to insert "EC" using rule 1.

I'm stuck again.

Let me try a different perspective. The *only* transition that changes the content of the string is rule 2.

The initial string is "74865EC56AF". Applying rule 2 transforms it into "74865E2044CF7E". Then, we apply rule 3, which requires the string to be "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".

The *only* way to reach the empty string is to apply rule 3. Therefore, the string *must* eventually become "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".

We start with "74865EC56AF". Applying rule 2 gives "74865E2044CF7E".

We are stuck. I suspect there is something wrong with the available transitions.

Let's think outside the box. Maybe rule 1 is a red herring. Maybe we don't need it.

Initial string: "74865EC56AF"
Apply rule 2: "74865E2044CF7E"
Now, we need "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" to apply rule 3.

It is impossible to get "ECECECECEC" in front of "74865E2044CF7E" given the rules.

I'm convinced this is impossible.
