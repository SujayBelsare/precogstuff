Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "777338E9" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "9"->"AE3"
2) "338EA"->"3B"
3) "BE3"->"DA"
4) "DA"->"0B"
5) "77"->"EF"
6) "E"->"8E"
7) "8EF730B"->""

Let's start by applying transitions that seem promising. We can apply transition 1 to '9', getting "777338EAE3". This doesn't seem immediately helpful. Transition 5 seems useful for reducing the '77's. Let's apply it once:

"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]

Now, let's apply transition 5 again:

"EF7338E9" -> "EEF338E9" [5]

Now let's apply transition 6 twice:

"EEF338E9" -> "8EEF338E9" [6]
"8EEF338E9" -> "8E8EF338E9" [6]

This doesn't seem to be leading anywhere productive. Let's try a different path from the beginning.

"777338E9"

Let's apply rule 1 to the 9:
"777338E9" -> "777338EAE3" [1]

Now let's apply rule 6 to the E:
"777338EAE3" -> "7773388EAE3" [6]

This also doesn't seem to be leading anywhere. Let's try applying rule 5 twice from the beginning:

"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]
"EF7338E9" -> "EEF338E9" [5]

Now let's apply rule 1 to the 9:
"EEF338E9" -> "EEF338EAE3" [1]

Now let's apply rule 2 to "338EA":
"EEF338EAE3" -> "EEF3BE3" [2]

Now let's apply rule 3 to BE3:
"EEF3BE3" -> "EEFDA" [3]

Now let's apply rule 4 to DA:
"EEFDA" -> "EEF0B" [4]

This doesn't seem correct either. Let's try a different approach.

"777338E9"

Apply transition 5 twice:
"777338E9" -> "EF7338E9" [5]
"EF7338E9" -> "EEF338E9" [5]

Apply transition 6 twice:
"EEF338E9" -> "8EEF338E9" [6]
"8EEF338E9" -> "8E8EF338E9" [6]

Apply transition 1:
"8E8EF338E9" -> "8E8EF338EAE3" [1]
This seems to be getting too long.

Let's try another approach. Start with transition 1:

"777338E9" -> "777338EAE3" [1]
Apply transition 2:
"777338EAE3" -> "7773BE3" [2]
Apply transition 3:
"7773BE3" -> "777DA" [3]
Apply transition 4:
"777DA" -> "7770B" [4]
Apply transition 5:
"7770B" -> "EF70B" [5]

I'm still not seeing a clear path to the final transition. Let's try to work backward. We need to get to "8EF730B".
So the second to last step must be something that can be converted to "8EF730B" using one of the rules.

Let's start with the end and work backward. To get "8EF730B" we need to use rule 7.

"8EF730B" -> ""

"777338E9"

What can give us "8EF730B"?

If we apply rule 5 twice, we get "EEF". If we apply rule 6 twice, we get "8EEF".
Then somehow we need to get "730B". Rule 1 transforms "9" -> "AE3".

Let's trace backward from the final state.
We need to obtain "8EF730B" somehow.
This requires us to have "EF" and "8". "EF" can be obtained by "77". "8" can be obtained by "E" -> "8E". "730B" can be obtained from "DA".

"777338E9"
Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"EF7338E9" [5]
Apply rule 5: "77"->"EF"
"EEF338E9" [5]
Apply rule 1: "9"->"AE3"
"EEF338EAE3" [1]
Apply rule 2: "338EA"->"3B"
"EEF3BE3" [2]
Apply rule 3: "BE3"->"DA"
"EEFDA" [3]
Apply rule 4: "DA"->"0B"
"EEF0B" [4]
Apply rule 6: "E"->"8E"
"8EEF0B" [6]
Apply rule 6: "E"->"8E"
"8E8EF0B" [6]

Still not working.
