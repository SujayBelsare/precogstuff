Okay, let's analyze the problem. The initial string is "3431F2DC". The goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions. The final transition, "953A06385CDC"->"", seems crucial. Let's try to work backward from that. We need to create the string "953A06385CDC".

Initial string: "3431F2DC"

1. **Target:** "953A06385CDC"
2. **Current:** "3431F2DC"

Let's see what transitions can be applied to the initial string.

*   "F2"->"06" (Rule 1)
*   "4"->"A06" (Rule 6)

Applying Rule 1 to "3431F2DC" gives us "343106DC".
Applying Rule 6 to "3431F2DC" gives us "3A0631F2DC".

Since the final string starts with "953", let's see if we can get a "95" using Rule 5: ""->"95". That doesn't help at this stage.

Let's try applying Rule 1 first:
"3431F2DC" -> "343106DC"  [1]

Now we have "343106DC". We want to get closer to "953A06385CDC".

Let's examine the target string and current string more closely.
Target: 953A06385CDC
Current: 343106DC

We have "3" in both, then we need "95". Let's try to create "95" out of something. Rule 5 is ""->"95" but we can't insert an empty string.

Let's look at the transitions again.
1) "F2"->"06"
2) "106"->"2BA"
3) "2B"->"43"
4) "43A"->"85C"
5) ""->"95"
6) "4"->"A06"
7) "953A06385CDC"->""

We have "343106DC". Let's apply Rule 6 to the "4":
"343106DC" -> "3A063106DC" [6]

Now we have "3A063106DC". Let's apply Rule 2 to the "106":
"3A063106DC" -> "3A0632BADC" [2]

Now we have "3A0632BADC". Apply Rule 3 to "2B":
"3A0632BADC" -> "3A06343ADC" [3]

Now we have "3A06343ADC". Apply Rule 6 to "4":
"3A06343ADC" -> "3A063A063ADC" [6]

This isn't getting us closer. Let's go back to "343106DC".

From "343106DC" let's apply Rule 2: "106"->"2BA"
"343106DC" -> "3432BADC" [2]

Now we have "3432BADC". Let's apply Rule 3: "2B"->"43"
"3432BADC" -> "34343ADC" [3]

Now we have "34343ADC". Apply Rule 6 to the first "4":
"34343ADC" -> "3A06343ADC" [6]

Now apply Rule 6 again to the next "4":
"3A06343ADC" -> "3A063A063ADC" [6]

Apply Rule 6 one last time:
"3A063A063ADC" -> "3A063A063A06DC" [6]

This is not working. I need to rethink my approach. Let's go back to the beginning.

"3431F2DC"

Apply Rule 1 first: "F2"->"06"
"3431F2DC" -> "343106DC" [1]

Apply Rule 2: "106"->"2BA"
"343106DC" -> "3432BADC" [2]

Apply Rule 3: "2B"->"43"
"3432BADC" -> "34343ADC" [3]

Now we have "34343ADC". Let's try Rule 4: "43A"->"85C"
"34343ADC" -> "34385CDC" [4]

Now we have "34385CDC". Let's apply rule 6 to the first "4":
"34385CDC" -> "3A06385CDC" [6]

Now we have "3A06385CDC". I need "95" at the beginning.

Let's start over and try to get "95" earlier.

"3431F2DC"

Apply Rule 6: "4"->"A06"
"3431F2DC" -> "3A0631F2DC" [6]

Apply Rule 1: "F2"->"06"
"3A0631F2DC" -> "3A063106DC" [1]

Apply Rule 2: "106"->"2BA"
"3A063106DC" -> "3A0632BADC" [2]

Apply Rule 3: "2B"->"43"
"3A0632BADC" -> "3A06343ADC" [3]

Apply Rule 4: "43A"->"85C"
"3A06343ADC" -> "3A06385CDC" [4]

I'm still missing the "95". Let's try a different approach entirely.

"3431F2DC"

Apply Rule 1: "F2"->"06"
"3431F2DC" -> "343106DC" [1]

Apply Rule 2: "106"->"2BA"
"343106DC" -> "3432BADC" [2]

Apply Rule 3: "2B"->"43"
"3432BADC" -> "34343ADC" [3]

Apply Rule 4: "43A"->"85C"
"34343ADC" -> "34385CDC" [4]

We have "34385CDC". Now what?

I'm stuck.

JW HELP!
