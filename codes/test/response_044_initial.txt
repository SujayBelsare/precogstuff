Let's start by analyzing the initial string "BCBADDCC" and the available transitions. The goal is to reach an empty string.

1) "DDC"->"ED"
2) "A"->"DF"
3) "BCBDFEDC"->"BECF"
4) "F"->"FD"
5) "BECFDD"->""

"BCBADDCC"

Let's try applying rule 2 first.
"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]

Now we have "BCBDFDCC". Let's try rule 1.
"BCBDFDCC" -> No match.
Let's try rule 4.
"BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]

Now we have "BCBDFDDCC". Let's try rule 1.
"BCBDFDDCC" -> No match.

Let's go back to "BCBADDCC" and try a different approach.
Let's try to make "BCBDFEDC" appear. It seems that it will lead us to BECF using rule 3.
We have "BCBADDCC". We need to transform "AD" into "DFED".
Apply rule 2: "BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
Now we have "BCBDFDCC".
Apply rule 4: "BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Now we have "BCBDFDDCC".
Apply rule 1: "BCBDFDDCC" -> No match. We need "DDC".

Going back to "BCBADDCC". Let's apply rule 1 first, if possible.
We don't have "DDC".
Let's apply rule 2:
"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]

Now "BCBDFDCC". We want "BCBDFEDC". We can only use rule 4 to add Ds.
"BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Now "BCBDFDDCC". We still need "E".
Rule 1 gives "DDC"->"ED".
We have "DDCC", so we can't apply rule 1 yet.
Let's try applying rule 4 again.
"BCBDFDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDCC" [4]
Still no "E".

Let's go back to "BCBDFDCC".
We need to make "DDC" appear. So we need "DCC".
We have "FDCC". We can apply rule 4 to get "FDDCC". Still no "DDC".
Let's try to get "BCBDFEDC":
"BCBDFDCC".
We need to transform "FDCC" to "FEDC". We can't do this directly.

Let's try a different approach. We need "BECFDD" to appear.
We have "BCBADDCC".

Apply rule 2: "BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
Apply rule 4: "BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Apply rule 1: No match.
Apply rule 4: "BCBDFDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDCC" [4]

Let's try to get "BCBDFEDC" from "BCBADDCC".
We need "AD" -> "FED".
Apply rule 2: "BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
We have "FD". We need "FE".

"BCBADDCC"
Rule 2: "BCBDFDCC" [2]
Rule 4: "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Rule 1: No match.
Rule 1 needs "DDC". We have "DDCC".
Let's try to get "BECFDD".
"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
"BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Now we have "BCBDFDDCC". We want "BECFDD".
"BCBDFDDCC" -> "BECFDD" is not directly possible.

Let's try to force "DDC" to appear.
"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
We need "DDC", so we need to change "F" to "D".

"BCBADDCC"
Rule 2: "BCBDFDCC" [2]
Rule 4: "BCBDFDDCC" [4]

We need "BECFDD" to appear to use rule 5.
Let's try to get "BCBDFEDC" first, then use rule 3 to get "BECF".

"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
We need "FD" to be "FED".
Let's apply rule 4 repeatedly.
"BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
Now we have "BCBDFDDCC".
"BCBDFDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDCC" [4]
"BCBDFDDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDDCC" [4]

Let's try another approach.
If we can get "BCBDFEDC", then we can get "BECF".

"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
We need "FD" to be "FED".
We need to insert "E" between "F" and "D".
Rule 1: "DDC"->"ED". So we need "DDC" somewhere.

"BCBADDCC" -> "BCBDFDCC" [2]
"BCBDFDCC" -> "BCBDFDDCC" [4]
"BCBDFDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDCC" [4]
"BCBDFDDDCC" -> "BCBDFDDDDCC" [4]
