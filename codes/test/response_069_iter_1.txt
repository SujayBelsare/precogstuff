Okay, let's try working backward from the target state, which is an empty string. The only transition that results in an empty string is rule 4:

4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

So, we need to transform the initial string "BFEFCCDCADC" into "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB". The "BFEF" prefix is already correct. So, we need to transform "CCDCADC" into "BDBDEEDCCB".

Let's analyze the available transitions again:
1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

The target string contains "EEDCCB". Rule 3 can produce "EEDCCB" from "BDEBCC". So, if we can get "BDEBCC", we can apply rule 3.

Let's try applying rule 1 to the initial string:
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC". We need to get "BDBDEEDCCB" from "CBCEBCC". Let's try to apply rule 2 to the first C:

"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]

This doesn't seem helpful. Let's try to apply rule 2 to all the Cs in "BFEFCBCEBCC".

"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBDBD" [2, 2, 2]

This is also not helpful. Let's go back to "BFEFCBCEBCC" and try something else. We want to generate "BDEBCC", so we want to apply rule 3.

Let's examine "BFEFCCDCADC" again. Let's apply rule 1:
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC". We want to get "BDBDEEDCCB". Let's try applying rule 2 to the first C in "BFEFCCDCADC" before applying rule 1.
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFBDCDCADC" [2]

That doesn't seem right. We need to apply rule 1 first.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC". We want to get "BDBDEEDCCB" from "CBCEBCC". Let's apply rule 2 to the first C in "CBCEBCC":
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]

This doesn't seem to help.
Let's apply rule 2 to the second C in "CBCEBCC":
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]

Still doesn't seem to help.
Let's apply rule 2 to the third C in "CBCEBCC":
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBCEBDD" [2]

Still doesn't seem to help. Let's try applying rule 2 to all the Cs.
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBDBD" [2, 2, 2]

We are not getting closer.

Let's try another approach. We want "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB". We have "BFEF". We need "BDBDEEDCCB".
We have "CCDCADC". Applying rule 1 gives "CBCEBCC".
Applying rule 2 gives "BBDBEBDBD".

Let's go back to "BFEFCCDCADC".
Apply rule 1: BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
Apply rule 2 to C: BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
We want to get BDEBCC from BBDBEBCC. Not possible.

Let's apply rule 2 to all Cs first:
BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFBDCBDCADBDC [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
This is not helpful.
Let's try this:
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]
We want to get "EEDCCB". Let's apply rule 3. We need "BDEBCC".

Let's try this:
1. "BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
2. Apply rule 2 to the second C: "BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]

We want to get "BDEBCC". We need to apply rule 2 to the first C.
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]

This doesn't work either. We need to get "BDEBCC".

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
We want to get "BDEBCC" at some point. We have "CBCEBCC". Let's try applying rule 2 to all Cs in "BFEFCCDCADC": "BFEFBDCBDCADBDC"
This is useless.

Let's focus on "BFEFCBCEBCC". We want "BDEBCC".
Let's try applying rule 2 to C one by one.
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBCEBDD" [2]

We need BDEBCC.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2]

"BFEFCBDBEBCC" -> not helpful

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBCE(BD)D" [2]

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
We want "BDEBCC"
Let's apply rule 2 to all "C"s
BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBDBD [2,2,2]
This is not helping.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
Then we want BDEBCC.
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> BFEFBDEBCC [?] can't do that.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
We want BDBDEEDCCB.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]

Still not helpful.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
Then BDEBCC

"BFEFCBCEBCC" = CBCEBCC.
We want to find the path to BDBDEEDCCB.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]

BFEFCBCEBCC [1] is where we are.

BFEFCCDCADC -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]

Okay, let's try to apply rule 2 multiple times to set up rule 3.
Initial string: "BFEFCCDCADC"
Target string: "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"

1) "DCADC"->"CEBCC"
2) "C"->"BD"
3) "BDEBCC"->"EEDCCB"
4) "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB"->""

We want to transform "BFEFCCDCADC" to "BFEFBDBDEEDCCB".

Apply rule 1: "BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

Now we have "BFEFCBCEBCC". We want to get "BDBDEEDCCB" from "CBCEBCC".

We want to use rule 3, which requires "BDEBCC".

Let's try to create "BDEBCC" from "CBCEBCC". We can apply rule 2 to the first two Cs.

"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2] - Wrong C
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFCBDBEBCC" [2] - Correct C

Now we have "BFEFCBDBEBCC".  We need a 'D' before EBCC.
Let's try to apply rule 2 to the first C in "BFEFCBCEBCC":
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]

This doesn't seem right.

Let's go back to applying rule 1:
"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]

We need "BDEBCC" from "CBCEBCC".
Apply rule 2 to the first C:
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2] No.
Apply rule 2 to the second C:

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBDBD" [2,2,2]

Nope.

Let's go back to BFEFCCDCADC

Try to apply rule 2 to all Cs first
BFEFBDCBDCADBDC

Nope.

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> "BFEFCBCEBCC" [1]
"BFEFCBCEBCC" -> BFEFCBDBEBCC [2]

"BFEFCCDCADC" -> BFEFCBCEBCC [1]
We want "BDEBCC".

We can apply rule 2 to the first C

BFEFCBCEBCC -> BFEFBBDBEBCC [2]
"BFEFCCDCADC" [initial]
"BFEFBDBDEEDCCB" [target - rule 4]

Apply rule 1: BFEFCBCEBCC

We can get EEDCCB from BDEBCC

Let's look at the initial BFEFCCDCADC
We have CDCADC We want BDBDEEDCCB

Now what?
BFEFCBCEBCC
Apply rule 2 to all Cs? No.

Okay, the key is to apply rule 2 to the correct 'C' after applying rule 1. We want to create 'BDEBCC' to utilize rule 3.

2. Apply rule 2 to the *first* 'C' in "CBCEBCC": "BFEFCBCEBCC" -> "BFEFBBDBEBCC" [2]
