Okay, let's analyze the problem and find a solution.

Initial string: "CBBEC"
Available transitions:
1) "BEC"->"CD"
2) "BC"->"BB"
3) "CBB"->"EEF"
4) "FD"->"ED"
5) "EEED"->""

We want to reach an empty string. Let's try to apply the rules strategically.

CBBEC -> Applying rule 1 is not possible.
CBBEC -> Applying rule 2 is not possible.
CBBEC -> Applying rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC
EEFEC - > No rules apply.

Let's try a different approach.

CBBEC -> Try to create an FD or EEED
CBBEC -> Applying rule 2 is not possible.
CBBEC -> Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

Let's try another approach.
CBBEC -> Apply rule 1 is not possible.
CBBEC -> Try to create BEC
CBBEC -> Apply rule 2: CBBEC -> CB BEC is not possible.

Let's try rule 3 first.
CBBEC -> EEFEC

Now, we want to get to EEED.

EEFEC -> no rules possible

Let's rethink. We want to get rid of the C.

CBBEC ->
If we could turn CBB into something, then we would have BEC which converts to CD.

CBBEC -> EEFEC

Let's try to go backwards.
To get "", we need EEED.
Before that, FD -> ED
Before that, BEC -> CD
Before that, CBB -> EEF
Before that, BC -> BB

CBBEC

Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC
Apply rule 4 is not possible
Apply rule 5 is not possible

Let's try a different approach.

We want to remove the C.

CBBEC. If we apply rule 1 first:
CBBEC is not possible.

Let's try applying rule 3:
CBBEC -> EEFEC.

Now we need to somehow turn this into EEED.

EEFEC. No rules applicable.

Let's try a different approach.
CBBEC
If we apply rule 2: BC -> BB is not possible.
If we apply rule 3: CBB -> EEF
CBBEC -> EEFEC

We want to make EEED.

Let's try to make BEC using rule 2: BC -> BB is not possible.

Let's apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

Let's try another approach.

CBBEC

Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC
No rules apply.

Let's try to do this backwards.

EEED -> ""
FD -> ED
BEC -> CD
CBB -> EEF
BC -> BB

CBBEC

Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC
No rules apply.

Let's call for help.
