Okay, John Watson is right. Rule 2, ""->"94", can only add "94" to the *beginning* of the string, not at the end. My previous attempt was incorrect in assuming I could add it at the end. I need to rethink my entire approach. The goal is to transform "B7FCD61" into "9418FA7394B7FCD08" so that I can apply rule 4.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"

1. Apply rule 1: "61"->"08"
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"

Now I have "B7FCD08". I need to get to "9418FA7394B7FCD08". This means I need to prepend "9418FA7394" to my current string. I can only add "94" to the beginning using rule 2. So, I need to create "18FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD08".

I can create "18FA73" from "9494" using rule 3.
I can create "94" from "" using rule 2.

Let's try building "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from right to left.

1. Apply rule 1: "61"->"08"
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"

2. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"B7FCD08" -> "94B7FCD08"

Now I have "94B7FCD08". I need to insert "18FA73" before "94". The only way to create "18FA73" is to use rule 3, which requires "9494". I already have "94" at the beginning of "B7FCD08". So I need to have "94" at the beginning again.

3. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"94B7FCD08" -> "9494B7FCD08"

4. Apply rule 3: "9494"->"18FA73"
"9494B7FCD08" -> "18FA73B7FCD08"

Now I have "18FA73B7FCD08". I need "94" at the beginning.

5. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"18FA73B7FCD08" -> "9418FA73B7FCD08"

Now I have "9418FA73B7FCD08". I need "94" before "B7FCD08".

6. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"9418FA73B7FCD08" -> "949418FA73B7FCD08"
7. Apply rule 3: "9494"->"18FA73"
"949418FA73B7FCD08" -> "18FA7318FA73B7FCD08"

This is not working. I am not able to reach the required string.

Let's try a different approach by starting with the end goal in mind and working backwards.
I need "9418FA7394B7FCD08".
The only way to get rid of this entire string is to use rule 4: "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

To get to "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD61":
1. I can transform "61" to "08" by applying rule 1: "61"->"08".
This gives me "B7FCD08". Now I need "9418FA7394" at the start.

2. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"B7FCD08" -> "94B7FCD08"

Now I need to insert "18FA7394" between the two "94" and "B7FCD08". Applying rule 3 to "9494" gives "18FA73".
So, I need to make two "94"s.

3. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"94B7FCD08" -> "9494B7FCD08"

4. Apply rule 3: "9494"->"18FA73"
"9494B7FCD08" -> "18FA73B7FCD08"

5. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"18FA73B7FCD08" -> "9418FA73B7FCD08"

Now I need to insert "94" between "18FA73" and "B7FCD08".

6. Apply rule 2: ""->"94"
"9418FA73B7FCD08" -> "949418FA73B7FCD08"

7. Apply rule 3: "9494"->"18FA73"
"949418FA73B7FCD08" -> "18FA7318FA73B7FCD08"

This is not working. I'm stuck.
