I understand. I'm getting lost in the weeds. I need to step back and rethink the overall strategy.

"FFDAADCEDAEEF"

I need to get "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF" somewhere in the string.

Apply rule 1:
"FFDAADCEDAEEF" -> "AAFECECDAEEF" [1]

Now I have "AAFECECDAEEF".

Let's apply rule 3.
"AAFECECDAEEF" -> "AAECBCECDAEEF" [3]

I have "AAECBCECDAEEF".

Now, instead of just randomly applying rule 2, let's look at what we have.
I have EC, EC, EC.

The target is "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".

I need to create "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".

Let's strategically apply rule 2. The goal is to create the substring.

Apply rule 2 to the *second* EC:
"AAECBCECDAEEF" -> "AAECBCBCDAEEF" [2]

Now I have "AAECBCBCDAEEF".

Apply rule 2 to the *first* EC:
"AAECBCBCDAEEF" -> "AACBCBCBCDAEEF" [2]

Now I have "AACBCBCBCDAEEF".

That's not getting me closer.

Okay, let's go back to "AAECBCECDAEEF".

Apply rule 2 to the *third* EC (which is actually a CB):
This doesn't work.

Okay, I need to try a different tactic.

"FFDAADCEDAEEF"
Apply rule 1:
"AAFECECDAEEF" [1]

Apply rule 3 to F:
"AAECBCECDAEEF" [3]

String = "AAECBCECDAEEF"

Apply Rule 2 to the first EC:
"AACBCECDAEEF" [2]

String = "AACBCECDAEEF"

Now, the target is "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".

The key is to *not* keep applying rule 2 randomly.

Let's try something completely different.

"FFDAADCEDAEEF"
Apply rule 1:
"AAFECECDAEEF" [1]

Apply rule 3
"AAECBCECDAEEF" [3]

Apply rule 2 to the *last* EC.
"AAECBCECDAEEF" -> "AAECBCECBD" - wait, no. It's AEEF

I'm completely lost.

"FFDAADCEDAEEF"
Rule 1: "AAFECECDAEEF" [1]
Rule 3: "AAECBCECDAEEF" [3]

I need "ECAAAECCBECDAEEF".

Let's give up on trying to strategically apply Rule 2.

I'm going to try a Hail Mary.

"FFDAADCEDAEEF"
1
3

Then, I'm stuck.

I am unable to find the solution.
