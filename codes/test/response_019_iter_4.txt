1. Rule 3 on the *last* E: DEDCAF
2. Rule 2: BECAF

John Watson provided the following feedback:
You were on the right track with [3, 2, 3], but the final string was "BAFCAF". To get "BAFDAF", think about which 'E' needs to be transformed into 'AF' in the *second* step.
Okay, John Watson is saying [3, 2, 3] is close, but BAFCAF is the result. I need BAFDAF.
The hint is in the *second* step.

DEDCE
1. Rule 3 to the LAST E: DEDCAF
2. Rule 2: BECAF
3. Rule 3 to the *FIRST* E: BAFCAF

The second step is Rule 2: DEC -> BE.
The question is, why is the LAST E, Rule 3, the correct first step?
Because it sets up the DEC for rule 2.

1. Rule 3 on the LAST E: DEDCAF
2. Rule 2: BECAF

What if I didn't use rule 3 on the last E?

You're almost there! You have "BAFCE". What rule can you apply to transform this into "BAFDAF"?
Okay, I am almost there! I have BAFCE. What rule can I apply to transform this into BAFDAF?

I can only use Rule 2 and Rule 3.

Rule 2 is DEC -> BE.
Rule 3 is E -> AF.

We need BAFCE -> BAFDAF

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Think carefully. You have "BAFCE". You can only use rule 3: E -> AF. Which 'E' in "BAFCE" should you transform to get "BAFDAF"?
Okay, think carefully. I have BAFCE. I can only use Rule 3: E -> AF.
Which E in BAFCE should I transform to get BAFDAF?

BAFCE

We need BAFDAF.

BAF C E

We need to transform the last E.

So, apply Rule 3 to the last E.

Then we get BAFCAF.

I am so dumb.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
You're right, applying rule 3 to the last 'E' in "BAFCE" gives you "BAFCAF", not "BAFDAF". It seems I'm having some trouble providing accurate guidance at this stage.

Let's try a different approach altogether, going back to the very basics.

The goal is to transform "DEDCE" into "BAFDAF". You have two rules:

1. "DEC" -> "BE"
2. "E" -> "AF"

Consider the *minimum* number of steps required. Since you need to introduce two "AF" sequences into the final string, you'll likely need to apply rule 2 at least once and rule 3 at least twice.

Now, think about the order. If you apply rule 2 *first*, transforming "DEDCE" into "BECE", how would you then proceed to create "BAFDAF"?
Okay, back to basics.
Transform DEDCE to BAFDAF using:
1. DEC -> BE
2. E -> AF

Consider the minimum number of steps required.
Since we need two AF sequences, we likely need to apply Rule 2 at least once and Rule 3 at least twice.

If we apply Rule 2 *first*, transforming DEDCE into BECE, how would we then proceed to create BAFDAF?

DEDCE
1. Apply Rule 2: BECE

How do we get BAFDAF from BECE?
We need a D. We can't create a D.

DEDCE
1. Apply Rule 3 to the *first* E: DAFDCE
2. Apply Rule 2: BAFCE

How do we get BAFDAF from BAFCE?
We need to turn
