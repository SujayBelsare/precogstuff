Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We have the following transitions:

1) "B"->"FC"
2) ""->"FB"
3) "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

Initial string: "DAFBA"

We need to transform "DAFBA" into "".

First, let's see if we can directly apply rule 3.  "FFCFBDAFFCA" is not present in "DAFBA", so rule 3 is not applicable directly.

We can apply rule 1 to the "B" in "DAFBA".
DAFBA -> DAFCA

Now we need to eliminate "DAFCA". Applying rule 1 again might create more characters instead of removing them so it is unlikely to work. Rule 2 inserts "FB". Rule 3 is still not directly applicable.

Let's try to create a situation where rule 3 can be used.  The target string for rule 3 has "B" in it, which comes from rule 1: "B"->"FC".  Also, rule 3 has "A".

DAFBA -> using rule 1 on B, becomes DAFCA. Now, if we can make the rest of the string to match the transition pattern in rule 3, i.e. "FFCFBDAFFCA". We have DAFCA, missing a lot in front.

Instead of applying rule 1 at the first possible "B", let's look ahead.  Rule 3, "FFCFBDAFFCA", is the goal.  If we can somehow create that string, we win.

Let's analyze DAFBA. If we apply rule 1, we get DAFCA. This doesn't seem very productive at first glance. We need to make "FFCFBDAFFCA". Let's consider creating B in that string by reversing transition 1 "FC"->"B". But this is not allowed since rule 1 is only in one direction.

Let's start by inserting an empty string using rule 2 at the beginning.
"DAFBA" -> "FBDAFBA"

Still doesn't help.
Let's start by inserting an empty string using rule 2 at the end.
"DAFBA" -> "DAFBAFB"
Still doesn't help.

Let's consider applying rule 1 to DAFBA.

DAFBA -> DAFCA

Can we apply rule 1 at the last character of this string? No, because it is A not B.
Can we apply rule 2 to any of the characters of this string? No, because it applies to the empty string.

Let's think about how to get the required "FFCFBDAFFCA". It contains a "B", which can only be produced using rule 1.

Apply rule 1 to DAFBA.
DAFBA -> DAFCA

Now, let's apply rule 2 to the beginning of string:
DAFCA -> FBDAFCA
Still does not look like rule 3 is obtainable.

Apply rule 2 to the end of string:
DAFCA -> DAFCAFB
Still does not look like rule 3 is obtainable.

Let's explore a different approach, since direct application of the rules isn't immediately helpful. The string "FFCFBDAFFCA" has a single B, which can be created using rule 1:  B -> FC. This means, we need "FFCF...FC...AFFCA". Let's consider the shortest substring containing the B, i.e. "BDA". If we can somehow turn DAFBA into FFCFBDAFFCA, that is, DAFBA becomes FFCF + BDA + FFCA.

Let's see if we can use rule 1 on DAFBA to obtain DAFCA. Now we have FCFBDAFFCA. If we can somehow add one more F, then add FF, we will be done.

Since the only way to add something is by applying rule 1 or 2. Rule 2 can add FB to the string, but no F.

Here is the solution:
1. Apply rule 1 to the 'B' in 'DAFBA' to obtain 'DAFCA'.
2. Apply rule 2 to the beginning of the string to get 'FBDAFCA'.
3. Apply rule 1 to the 'B' in 'FBDAFCA' to get 'FBFCDAFCA'.
4. Apply rule 2 to the beginning of the string to get 'FBFBFCDAFCA'.
5. Apply rule 1 to the 'B' in 'FBFBFCDAFCA' to get 'FBFCFCFCDAFCA'.
6. Apply rule 2 to the beginning of the string to get 'FBFBFCFCFCDAFCA'.
This is becoming very long and does not seem right.

Let's rethink.
1) "B"->"FC"
2) ""->"FB"
3) "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

"DAFBA"

Apply rule 1: DAFBA -> DAFCA.
Apply rule 2 at beginning: DAFCA -> FBDAFCA.
Apply rule 2 at end: DAFCA -> DAFCAFB
Apply rule 1 to FBDAFCA: FBDAFCA -> FBFCDAFCA
Apply rule 1 to DAFCAFB: DAFCAFB -> DAFFCCAFB

If we insert FB:
"DAFBA" -> "DAFBAFB" or "FBDAFBA"
DAFBAFB -> DAFFCCAFB

"FFCFBDAFFCA"

Apply rule 1:
DAFBA -> DAFCA

Apply rule 2 to beginning of string: DAFCA -> FBDAFCA

Final Answer: The correct answer is [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
DAFBA -> DAFCA (1)
DAFCA -> FBDAFCA (2)
FBDAFCA -> FBFCDAFCA (1)
FBFCDAFCA -> FBFBFCFCDAFCA (2)
FBFBFCFCDAFCA -> FBFBFCFCFCADAFCA (1)
FBFBFCFCFCADAFCA -> FBFBFCFCFCBFCDAFCA (2)
This strategy is not going to work because it's making the string longer.

Let's rethink AGAIN. The goal is "".
DAFBA
Rule 3: "FFCFBDAFFCA"->""

Let's apply rule 1 on DAFBA.
DAFBA -> DAFCA
If we can create FFCFB, then we can apply rule 3?
Add F and C
DAFBA -> DAFCA

1. DAFBA -> DAFCA (rule 1)
2. Insert FB in the middle: DAFFBCA - Doesn't seem right
3. Insert FB at the end: DAFCAFB - Doesn't seem right

Okay, let's try this:
DAFBA -> DAFCA [1]
Let's insert at the beginning FB [2]
FBDAFCA
DAFBA -> FBDAFBA [2]
FBDAFBA -> FBFCDAFBA [1]

DAFBA -> DAFCA [1]
Now what? Can we create FFCF from the given string?
Let's try inserting FB at the beginning: FBDAFCA
Then apply rule 1 again?
FBDAFCA -> FBFCDAFCA [1]

Let's try again:

1. DAFBA -> DAFCA [1]
2.  DAFCA -> DAFCAFB [2]
3. DAFCAFB -> DAFFCCAFB

Okay. Let's try.
DAFBA
1. DAFBA -> DAFCA [1]
2. DAFCA -> FBDAFCA [2]
3. FBDAFCA -> FBFCDAFCA [1]
4. FBFCDAFCA -> FFCFCDAFCA [2]

Still not looking like rule 3 is available.

Final try.
"DAFBA" -> ""
1. DAFBA -> FBDAFBA (2)
2. FBDAFBA -> FBFCDAFBA (1)
3. FBFCDAFBA -> FFCFCDAFBA (2)
4. FFCFCDAFBA -> FFCFCDAFFBCA (2)

It appears there's a trick. Empty string insertion only happens at the beginning of the string.
1. DAFBA -> DAFCA (1)
2. DAFCA -> FBDAFCA (2)
3. FBDAFCA -> FFCDAFCA (2)

This is not right.

DAFBA - Initial string
FFCFBDAFFCA - Target

1: B -> FC

DAFBA -> DAFCA (1)
"" -> FB (2) This is the insertion

The correct answer is [].
DAFBA

I am unable to provide a valid answer. It is likely that the problem is unsolvable.
TERMINATED.
