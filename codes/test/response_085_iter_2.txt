Okay, I see the hint. I need to create "6665BB6" from "669BB6". The only way to do that is to turn the "9" in "669BB6" into "65". But there's no '9' available to change directly. Let's see if we can create "669BB6" from "9C3FEC0F9".

Initial string: "9C3FEC0F9"

1. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "65C3FEC0F9".
2. Apply transition 1: "C3FEC0F9" -> "86C5". String becomes "6586C5".
3. Apply transition 3: "586" -> "5B". String becomes "65BC5".
4. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "669BC5".
5. Apply transition 5: "C5" -> "B6". String becomes "669BB6".

Now we have "669BB6". We need to turn the "9" into "65". The only way to do this is to apply transition 2 again. But there's no '9' in the string anymore.

Let's try a different order.

Initial string: "9C3FEC0F9"

1. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65".  String becomes "65C3FEC0F9".
2. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "669C3FEC0F9".
3. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "6665C3FEC0F9".
4. Apply transition 1: "C3FEC0F9" -> "86C5". String becomes "666586C5".
5. Apply transition 3: "586" -> "5B". String becomes "66655BC5".
6. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "666569BC5".  This doesn't lead to "6665BB6".

Okay, let's try to work backward from "6665BB6". We need to use rule 6: "6665BB6" -> "".
So, we need to somehow get "6665BB6" from "9C3FEC0F9".

Let's keep "order" in mind.

Initial string: "9C3FEC0F9"
1. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "65C3FEC0F9".
2. Apply transition 1: "C3FEC0F9" -> "86C5". String becomes "6586C5".
3. Apply transition 3: "586" -> "5B". String becomes "65BC5".
4. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "669BC5".
5. Apply transition 5: "C5" -> "B6". String becomes "669BB6".

Now we have "669BB6". We need to transform this into "6665BB6". We can do this by changing the '9' into '65'.

6. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". This is NOT applicable.

Let's go back to step 4. Instead of applying transition 5, let's apply transition 4 again.
1. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "65C3FEC0F9".
2. Apply transition 1: "C3FEC0F9" -> "86C5". String becomes "6586C5".
3. Apply transition 3: "586" -> "5B". String becomes "65BC5".
4. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "669BC5".
5. Apply transition 2 (on the 9 created in step 4): "9" -> "65" is NOT possible.

Let's rethink.
We have the sequence [2,1,3,4] which leads to "669BC5".
"669BC5". We want "6665BB6".

Here's the correct solution:

1. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "65C3FEC0F9".
2. Apply transition 1: "C3FEC0F9" -> "86C5". String becomes "6586C5".
3. Apply transition 3: "586" -> "5B". String becomes "65BC5".
4. Apply transition 5: "C5" -> "B6". String becomes "65BB6".
5. Apply transition 4: "5" -> "69". String becomes "669BB6".
6. Apply transition 2: "9" -> "65". String becomes "6665BB6".
7. Apply transition 6: "6665BB6" -> "". String becomes "".

The solution is [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6].

```
[2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6]
