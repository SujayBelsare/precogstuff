Okay, let's analyze the problem again with the suggestion from John Watson.

Initial string: "4E592"
Goal string: "0FB8F08" (after which we apply rule 6 to get "")

Available transitions:
1) "4E"->"0F"
2) "2"->"8D"
3) "5"->"B2"
4) "98D"->"E8"
5) "DE"->"F0"
6) "0FB8F08"->""

We need to transform "4E592" into "0FB8F08".

1. Apply rule 1: "4E" -> "0F". "4E592" becomes "0F592".
Now we have "0F592". We need to get to "0FB8F08". So, we need to transform "592" to "B8F08".

2. Apply rule 3: "5" -> "B2". "0F592" becomes "0FB292".
Now we have "0FB292". We need to get to "0FB8F08". So, we need to transform "292" to "8F08".

3. Apply rule 2: "2" -> "8D". "0FB292" becomes "0FB298D".
Now we have "0FB298D". We need to get to "0FB8F08". So, we need to transform "298D" to "8F08".

4. Apply rule 4: "98D" -> "E8". "0FB298D" becomes "0FB2E8".
Now we have "0FB2E8". We need to get to "0FB8F08". So, we need to transform "2E8" to "8F08".

Now, we need to change "2E" into "8F0".
5. Apply rule 2: "2"->"8D". "0FB2E8" becomes "0FB8DE8".
Now we have "0FB8DE8". We need to get to "0FB8F08". So, we need to transform "DE8" to "F08".

6. Apply rule 5: "DE"->"F0". "0FB8DE8" becomes "0FB8F08".

Now we have "0FB8F08".

The transitions are: 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5.
Let's verify:
"4E592"
1. 4E -> 0F: "0F592"
2. 5 -> B2: "0FB292"
3. 2 -> 8D: "0FB298D"
4. 98D -> E8: "0FB2E8"
5. 2 -> 8D: "0FB8DE8"
6. DE -> F0: "0FB8F08"

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]}$
