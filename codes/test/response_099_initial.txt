Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "167B5D" and we want to reach "".

Available transitions:
1) "167B"->"9E"
2) "9E5"->"B2"
3) "B2D"->"A1"
4) "A"->"BE5"
5) "E"->"27"
6) "751"->"F5"
7) "B2F5"->""

Let's see if applying the rules directly gets us anywhere.

167B5D -> 9E5D (Rule 1)
9E5D -> B2D (Rule 2)
B2D -> A1 (Rule 3)
A1 -> BE51 (Rule 4)
BE51 -> B2751 (Rule 5)

This doesn't seem to lead anywhere useful. Let's try a different approach. We need to create "B2F5" at some point to use Rule 7.

Looking at the initial string "167B5D", we can apply rule 1 to get "9E5D".
Now we have "9E5D". Applying Rule 2 gives "B2D".
Then Rule 3, "B2D" -> "A1".
Now we have "A1". Applying Rule 4 gives "BE51".
We want "F5" somehow, and Rule 6 gives us "751"->"F5". So we want 751 somewhere.
We have "BE51" and Rule 5 gives "E"->"27", so let's apply Rule 5.
BE51 -> B2751
Now we have 2751, and rule 6 is 751->F5 so we have:
B2751->B2F5.
Finally, we apply Rule 7, B2F5 -> "".

So the transitions are:
1 -> 9E5D
2 -> B2D
3 -> A1
4 -> BE51
5 -> B2751
6 -> B2F5
7 -> ""

The list of transitions is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$
