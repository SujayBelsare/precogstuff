Okay, John Watson is telling me to consider the order of operations.

Initial string: CBBEC
Available transitions:
1) "BEC"->"CD"
2) "BC"->"BB"
3) "CBB"->"EEF"
4) "FD"->"ED"
5) "EEED"->""

Let's try applying rule 2 first, as John Watson suggested.

CBBEC ->
Rule 2: BC -> BB is not applicable.

However, let's think about what we *want* to get.
We want to eventually get to EEED.

Let's try a different strategy:
The goal is to get EEED.
We have CBBEC.

Let's apply rule 3 first:
CBBEC -> EEFEC

Then, we want to turn FEC into ED.
If we could create FD somehow, we could use rule 4.

Let's try to apply Rule 2:
CBBEC. We need BC.

Let's try this sequence:
1. CBBEC
2. Apply rule 2 is not applicable.
3. Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

Now we have EEFEC.
We need to get to EEED.

We need to transform FEC into ED.
Can we create FD?

What if we apply Rule 1 first?
CBBEC. Rule 1: BEC -> CD
CBBEC -> CBBCD

Now we have CBBCD.
Rule 3: CBB -> EEF is applicable.
CBBCD -> EEFCD

Now we have EEFCD.
This doesn't seem promising.

Let's try applying rule 2 *before* rule 3.

CBBEC.
We want to apply rule 2: BC -> BB.
But we have CBB.

Let's try something completely different.
CBBEC
Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

EEFEC.
We want EEED.

Apply rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

Now, if we could turn FC into D, we'd be set.
But there's no rule to do that.

Let's think backwards.
EEED -> ""

FD -> ED
BEC -> CD
CBB -> EEF
BC -> BB

CBBEC

Let's try rule 3: CBBEC -> EEFEC

Now we have EEFEC.

Let's try to get BEC.
We need to introduce BEC somehow.

CBBEC -> EEFEC

I'm still stuck.

JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Consider applying transition 1 before transition 3.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
