Okay, let's analyze the problem. The goal is to transform "74865EC56AF" into "".

Available transitions:
1) ""->"EC"
2) "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"->""

Initial string: "74865EC56AF"

Let's try to reason step by step how to reach the target string of transition 3.

1. We have "74865EC56AF". The only transition that applies is transition 2:  "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
So, "74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E" (using transition 2).

2. We need to somehow introduce "ECECECECEC" and "E" around "74865E2044CF7E". The only way to introduce "E" and "C" is through transition 1: ""->"EC". However, we can't directly apply transition 1 now, because it only works on the empty string. This means we're on the wrong track. The goal is to reach the string in transition 3 "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".

Let's examine the target string "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E". It contains "74865E2044CF7E". We got this part by applying transition 2 to the original string. If we can somehow prepend "ECECECECEC" to "74865E2044CF7E" that we already obtained, we'd be set.

Let's revisit the original string "74865EC56AF". We want to apply transition 2 at some point to get "74865E2044CF7E".  The only way to get rid of everything is through transition 3. So we must have a string of the form "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" at some point.

The initial string is "74865EC56AF". We can apply transition 2:
"74865EC56AF" -> "74865E2044CF7E"

Now we need to somehow add "ECECECECEC" to the beginning. But we cannot directly add to the beginning. There is no transition to add to the beginning.

I realize what's happening. We cannot directly apply transition 2 at first. There are no transitions to move the substring "C56AF". Transition 1 adds "EC" only to the empty string.

Consider the target string: "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E".  The substring "2044CF7E" results from the replacement of "C56AF". So, we must first apply rule 2.
The initial string is "74865EC56AF".
Apply rule 2: "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
"74865EC56AF" becomes "74865E2044CF7E"
Now we need to create "ECECECECEC" before "74865E2044CF7E". But rule 1 can only be applied when the string is empty. We are stuck.

However, the problem statement states that the problem can be solved. So we must consider what to do to get the target string.

Let's rethink the problem. We have to use transition 3. So, "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" must appear at some stage.
The initial string is "74865EC56AF".
Apply rule 2: "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
"74865EC56AF" becomes "74865E2044CF7E"
We want to get "ECECECECEC" before this. This seems impossible.

I have discovered the error. The empty string has no position, so when "" is in the left-hand side of the transition, this transition can never be applied.
Therefore transition 1 is invalid.

Let's reconsider the problem. We have to convert "74865EC56AF" into "".
Available transitions:
1) ""->"EC"
2) "C56AF"->"2044CF7E"
3) "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E"->""

Initial string: "74865EC56AF"
We must use transition 3 at some point. The target string of transition 3 is "".
So "ECECECECEC74865E2044CF7E" has to be reached. The only way to get "2044CF7E" is by using transition 2.
So we must have "C56AF" in the input string "74865EC56AF".
The initial string is "74865EC56AF". Applying transition 2, we get "74865E2044CF7E". We need to prepend "ECECECECEC" to it.
Since transition 1 does not help. This problem cannot be solved and is a trick question.

Final Answer: The problem is not solvable due to transition rule 1 being invalid.
Since I must answer with a list of transitions:
[2]
This would result in "74865E2044CF7E". There is no way to convert this string into "".
Due to the impossible situation of not being able to add "ECECECECEC", I cannot use rule 3 and the final string can never be the empty string.
