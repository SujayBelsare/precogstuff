Okay, let's analyze this problem carefully. We want to convert "ABBFAEABF" to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "A"->"EF"
2) "EFE"->"EFF"
3) "EFBBFEFFEFBF"->""

Initial string: "ABBFAEABF"

Let's try applying transition 1 to the first "A":

ABBFAEABF -> EFBBFAEABF

Now, apply transition 1 to the next "A":

EFBBFAEABF -> EFBBFEEFABF

Apply transition 1 to the next "A":

EFBBFEEFABF -> EFBBFEEFEFBF

We now have EFBBFEEFEFBF.  Notice that transition 3 involves a similar pattern. Let's try to isolate "EFBBFEFFEFBF".

EFBBFEEFEFBF

Now, apply transition 2 on "EFE":

EFBBFEEFEFBF -> EFBBFEFFEBF

Now we have EFBBFEFFEBF. It looks very similar to transition 3, but not quite.

Let's go back to EFBBFEEFEFBF, instead apply transition 1 to the very last A:

EFBBFEEFEFBF -> EFBBFEEFEFBF

That didn't help.

Let's go back to EFBBFEEFABF and apply transition 1 to the very last "A" in the string "ABBFAEABF":

ABBFAEABF -> ABBFAEFBF

Now apply transition 1 to the next 'A':

ABBFAEFBF -> EFBBFAEFBF

Apply transition 1 to the next 'A':

EFBBFAEFBF -> EFBBFEFEFBF

Apply transition 2 to "EFE":

EFBBFEFEFBF -> EFBBFEFFEFBF

Finally, apply transition 3:

EFBBFEFFEFBF -> ""

The sequence of transitions is: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}$
