Okay, I see my mistake. I was so focused on getting "9418FA7394" that I forgot to actually apply the *final* rule.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"

1. Apply rule 1: "61" -> "08"
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
Current string: "B7FCD08"

I need to create "9418FA7394" at the beginning of "B7FCD08".

2. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD08" -> "B7FCD0894"

3. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0894" -> "B7FCD089494"

4. Apply rule 3: "9494" -> "18FA73"
"B7FCD089494" -> "B7FCD0818FA73"

Now I need to insert "94" after "18FA73".

5. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA73" -> "B7FCD0818FA7394"

Now I have "B7FCD0818FA7394".

I need "9418FA7394B7FCD08".

So I need to apply rule 2 once more.

6. Apply rule 2 (at the end): "" -> "94"
"B7FCD0818FA7394" -> "9418FA7394B7FCD08"

7. Apply rule 4: "9418FA7394B7FCD08" -> ""
"9418FA7394B7FCD08" -> ""

Therefore, the correct sequence of transitions is [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4].

```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4]
