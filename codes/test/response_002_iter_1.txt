Okay, I realize my initial assessment was flawed. I was too focused on directly applying the available transitions to the initial string. The key insight is that transition 1, which adds "BF" to an empty string, is crucial, even though the initial string is "EBDDB". This strongly suggests that the solution involves somehow emptying the string first, then using transition 1 to build up the target string for transition 2.

Since the goal is to convert "EBDDB" to an empty string and then to "BFBFBFBFEBDDB", and since the only available operation is to apply transition 2 when the string is equal to "BFBFBFBFEBDDB", this problem is mathematically impossible. I need to make the source string be the target string.

Therefore, the problem is unsolvable.
JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
The problem is indeed solvable. Carefully review the transitions and their application. You might be overlooking a crucial aspect of how the transitions can be combined or applied in a specific order. Remember, the transitions are applied to the first matching substring.
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
