Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. The initial string is "16323E51" and the goal is to reduce it to an empty string using the given transitions.

Available transitions:
1) "3"->"A3"
2) "23E"->"C1"
3) "A"->"A1"
4) "151"->"976CC"
5) "13"->"AA"
6) "16A1AAC976CC"->""

Let's try applying transitions and see where it leads.

16323E51 -> 16A323E51 (1)
16A323E51 -> 16A3C151 (2)
This doesn't seem to directly lead to the final transition. Let's try a different approach. We want to get the string "16A1AAC976CC" at some point.

Looking at transition 6, we need "16A1AAC976CC". We have "16" in the initial string. Let's try to create the rest.
We see "3" in "16323E51". Applying rule 1 gives "A3".
"16323E51" -> "16A323E51" (1)
Next, we need to create "A1" from "A3". We can't do that directly.
Let's try applying rule 5 to "16323E51". We can create "AA" from "13".
"16323E51" -> "16AA23E51" (5)
Now, let's consider "23E" -> "C1".
"16AA23E51" -> "16AAC151" (2)
Now, we have "16AAC151". We need to get to "16A1AAC976CC".
We can apply rule 3 to A to get A1. So, A -> A1
"16AAC151" -> "16A1AC151" (3)
Now, we have "16A1AC151". We want to produce "16A1AAC976CC". We need to get "C976CC" at the end.
We have "151". Apply rule 4.
"151" -> "976CC"
"16A1AC151" -> "16A1AC976CC" (4)
We have "16A1AC976CC". We want "16A1AAC976CC".
So we want to add an A. We have a C.
Let's go back to the beginning.
16323E51
16AA23E51 (5)
16AAC151 (2)
16A1AC151 (3)
16A1A1C151 (3)
16A1AA151 (5)
Doesn't seem to be working.
