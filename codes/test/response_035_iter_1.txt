Okay, I see. The key is that the only way to get to an empty string is to use rule 3. So, we need to transform "DBFFA" into "EFEFEFEFDFFA". Rule 2 adds "EF" to an empty string, but that is not helpful in this case. Rule 1 transforms "DBFF" into "DFF". This seems to shorten the string which is not helpful. Let's think step by step.

We need to somehow introduce several "EF" sequences, along with a "DFFA" at the end. The initial string is "DBFFA".

Let's analyze what we *need*. We need to end up with "EFEFEFEFDFFA". The initial string is "DBFFA". The only way to add "EF" is through rule 2. However, it seems impossible to reach the final string.

I'm still stuck. I need to find a way to construct "EFEFEFEFDFFA" from "DBFFA".

Let's try to find a sequence of operations that might lead to the desired string, even if it looks counterintuitive at first.

We start with "DBFFA".
1. Apply rule 1: "DBFF"->"DFF". This gives "DFFA". We are getting closer to "DFFA" part of the target string.
Now we have "DFFA".
Now we need to somehow generate "EFEFEFEF". I don't see how.

I'm still stuck.
JW HELP!
John Watson provided the following feedback:
Sometimes, the simplest solution is the correct one. Review the available transitions and the initial string carefully. Are there any transitions that might seem useless at first glance but could be crucial for solving the puzzle?
Based on this feedback, please provide an improved solution attempt.
Output the transitions as a list (e.g., [1, 3, 1, 1, 4]).
