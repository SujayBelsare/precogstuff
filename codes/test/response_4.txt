Okay, I understand. I must provide the correct sequence of transitions that transforms the initial string "CDBFC" into an empty string "", following the given rules and transitions. Any mistake will lead to my termination, so I will proceed with utmost caution.

Initial string: "CDBFC"

1.  **Transition 1: "BFC"->"FE"** applies to the string "CDBFC". The first occurrence of "BFC" is at index 2.
    Applying this transition transforms "CDBFC" to "CDFE".
    String: "CDFE"

2.  **Transition 3: "CDFE"->""** applies to the string "CDFE".
    Applying this transition transforms "CDFE" to "".
    String: ""

Thus, the final sequence of transitions is [1, 3].

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[1, 3]}$
