Okay, let's analyze the problem carefully. We want to transform "EDCBE" to "".

Available transitions:
1) "DCBE"->"DDCC"
2) "ED"->"CC"
3) ""->"FD"
4) "FDFDCCDCC"->""

Initial string: "EDCBE"

1. Apply transition 2 to the initial string "EDCBE":
   EDCBE -> "CC"CBE.  This does not lead to the required transition in rule 4. We must find some other way.

2. Let's see if we can create the string "FDFDCCDCC".
   If we could transition to "FDFDCCDCC", we could use rule 4 directly.
   We need to get "ED" to "CC" eventually, and "DCBE" to "DDCC".

3. Let's try to manipulate "EDCBE" to get "DCBE" first. We can prepend "FD" to the string.
   "EDCBE". No way to add "FD" in the beginning without removing "E"
   Let's try and get rid of the E using rule 2.

4. Okay, starting with EDCBE. Let's try using transition 2 "ED"->"CC":
   EDCBE -> CCCBE

5. This still doesn't seem to be getting us closer. Let's try a different approach. Let's apply rule 2 to remove the E:
   EDCBE -> CCCBE.

6. Let's try to get DCBE from the original EDCBE.
   Apply rule 2 "ED"->"CC" to EDCBE to get:
   EDCBE -> CCCBE

7. Let's try to apply rule 1 on EDCBE:
   EDCBE -> E(DCBE) -> EDDCC

8. Okay, so EDCBE -> EDDCC.
   Then we can apply rule 2 to the ED:
   EDDCC -> CCDCC

9. We want FDFDCCDCC, so let's see if we can apply rule 3 to add FD:
   If the string is empty, it becomes FD. So we need to reduce EDCBE to nothing.

10. Let's consider the goal string "FDFDCCDCC". It contains "CC".
   We can get "CC" from "ED".
   Let's try to get "ED" somewhere:

11. Let's try to use rule 1 on the initial string.
    EDCBE -> EDDCC

12. Then rule 2:
    EDDCC -> CCDCC

13. Now, we need FDFDCCDCC. We can get two FDs by applying rule 3 twice to an empty string.

14. Apply transition 2 to EDCBE:
    EDCBE -> CCCBE

15. Now, let's try the following:
    EDCBE -> EDDCC using rule 1.
    EDDCC -> CCDCC using rule 2.

We are at CCDCC.  We want FDFDCCDCC

Let's consider a different approach.

Since we want to end with an empty string, and we have rule 4 which changes "FDFDCCDCC" to empty, let's try to make our way to that string.

EDCBE. We need to introduce FD somehow.

Here's the solution:
1. Apply rule 1: "DCBE"->"DDCC" to EDCBE. Results in EDDCC. [1]
2. Apply rule 2: "ED"->"CC" to EDDCC. Results in CCDCC. [2]
3. Apply rule 3: ""->"FD" to empty string, but we are at CCDCC, so skip it.
4. Apply rule 3: ""->"FD", still at CCDCC.
5. It looks like we need to create the empty string first so we can use rule 3 and rule 4.

Let's try a different approach:
1. EDCBE -> EDDCC [1]
2. EDDCC -> CCDCC [2]

We need FDFDCCDCC to apply rule 4. We need to introduce FDFD.

I am stuck. Let's rethink

EDCBE -> ""

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[]}$
