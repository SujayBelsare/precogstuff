Okay, I need to try something that doesn't result in "EBABEBADCFFCFAC".

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1.  Apply rule 3 to the *second* E:
    "EDDBEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Now apply rule 3 to the first E:
    "EBDBEBADCFFCFAC"
3. Now apply rule 2 to the DE
    "EBABABEBADCFFCFAC"

This is not useful.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EDDEBADCFFCFBF"

2. Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFBF"

3. Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not working.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

I need to find the right sequence.

1. Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"
3. Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"
3. Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

I will try a completely different sequence.

1. Apply rule 1: AC -> BF
"EDDEBADCFFCFBF"

2. Apply rule 3: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFBF"

3. Apply rule 2: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"

2. AC -> BF
"EABEBADCFFCFBF"

3. E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not working.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"

2. Apply rule 1 to the AC at the end: AC -> BF
"EBDEBADCFFCFBF"

3. Apply rule 2 to the DE: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

That's not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

I need to find a sequence that will lead to the target.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"

2. Apply rule 3 to the E at position 5: E -> EB
"EBDBEBADCFFCFAC"

3. Apply rule 2 to DE: DE -> AB
"EBABABEBADCFFCFAC"

This is not working.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 2 to DE: DE -> AB
"EABEBADCFFCFAC"

2. Apply rule 3 to first E: E -> EB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

3. Apply rule 3 to second E: E -> EB
"EBEBEBADCFFCFAC"

4. Apply rule 1 to AC: AC -> BF
"EBEBEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not working.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"

2. Apply rule 2 to the DE: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

3. Apply rule 1 to AC: AC -> BF
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

This is not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"

2. Apply rule 2 to the DE: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

3. Apply rule 3 to the third E: E -> EB

This is not working.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: "E" -> "EB"
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Apply rule 2 to DE: "DE" -> "AB"
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"
3. Apply rule 1 to AC: "AC" -> "BF"
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"
4. Apply Rule 4

This is incorrect.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
1. Apply rule 3 to the first E
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Apply rule 2 to the DE
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"
3. Apply rule 1 to the AC
"EBABEBADCFFCFBF"

That's not it.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

I need to get to "EBBDABBADCFFCFBF".

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Apply rule 3 to the first E: E -> EB
"EBDEBADCFFCFAC"
2. Apply rule 2 to the DE: DE -> AB
"EBABEBADCFFCFAC"

Stuck.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Rule 2: EABEBADCFFCFAC
2. Rule 3: EBABEBADCFFCFAC
3. Rule 1: EBABEBADCFFCFBF

I need to find a different approach.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"

1. Rule 3: EBDEBADCFFCFAC
2. Rule 2: EBABEBADCFFCFAC
3. Rule 1: EBABEBADCFFCFBF

Incorrect

I am completely stuck.

"EDDEBADCFFCFAC"
