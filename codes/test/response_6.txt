Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle.

Initial String: "FAFEFD"
Available Transitions:
1) "FD"->"FE"
2) "E"->"DC"
3) "FAFDCCFE"->""

Here's the reasoning:

1. Apply transition 1 to "FAFEFD":
   FAFEFD -> FAFEFE  [1]

2. Apply transition 2 to "FAFEFE":
   FAFEFE -> FAFDCFE [2]

3. Apply transition 3 to "FAFDCFE":
   FAFDCFE -> "" [3]

Solution: [1, 2, 3]
