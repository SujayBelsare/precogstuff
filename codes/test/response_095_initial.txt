Okay, let's start.

Initial string: "4E387CC50"
Available transitions:
1) "C50"->"AF"
2) "4"->"4B"
3) "4B"->"B6"
4) "E3"->"3D76C679F"
5) "CAF"->"16"
6) "87"->"691"
7) "B63D76C679F69116"->""

First, I want to see if there are any immediate simplifications. I see "4" at the start, which can be converted to "4B".
4E387CC50 -> 4BE387CC50  [2]

Now I have "4B" which can be converted to "B6".
B6E387CC50 [3]

Now I have "E3" which can be converted to "3D76C679F"
B63D76C679F87CC50 [4]

Now I have "87" which can be converted to "691"
B63D76C679F691CC50 [6]

Now I have "C50" which can be converted to "AF"
B63D76C679F691CAF [1]

Now I have "CAF" which can be converted to "16"
B63D76C679F69116 [5]

Now I have "B63D76C679F69116" which can be converted to "".
"" [7]

The solution is: [2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{[2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7]}$
