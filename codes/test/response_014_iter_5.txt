Okay, I see. John Watson is hinting that I need to use rule 1, but only once and carefully. The goal is to get to "FFCFBDAFFCA" somehow, then use rule 3.

Initial string: "DAFBA"

1. Apply rule 1: "B"->"FC". The first B is in "DAFBA", so we get "DAFFCA".
   "DAFBA" -> "DAFFCA"

Now we need to transform "DAFFCA" into "FFCFBDAFFCA". This looks impossible without rule 2.

Let's rethink. Rule 2: ""->"FB". This allows us to insert "FB" anywhere. But it only applies to the *first* empty string, so we can only add it to the beginning.

Since rule 2 adds "FB" to the beginning, and rule 1 replaces "B" with "FC", we need to use these rules in conjunction to construct the final string.

Initial string: "DAFBA"

1. Apply rule 1: "DAFBA" -> "DAFFCA"
2. We need to insert "FFCFBD" before "AFFCA" to get "FFCFBDAFFCA". Rule 2 adds "FB" to the beginning. This is not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Let's try working backward from the goal.

Goal: "FFCFBDAFFCA" -> "" (using rule 3)
Initial string: "DAFBA"

We need to transform "DAFBA" into "FFCFBDAFFCA".

Let's explore applying rule 1 repeatedly, even if it doesn't seem helpful immediately.

Initial string: "DAFBA"

1. Apply rule 1: "DAFBA" -> "DAFFCA"
We want to get to "FFCFBDAFFCA". We need to insert "FFCFBD" before "AFFCA".

Let's consider the differences between "DAFFCA" and "FFCFBDAFFCA":
- "D" needs to become "FFCFBD"
- "A" stays as "A"
- "FFCA" stays as "FFCA"

Okay. What if we use rule 2 to introduce "FB" at the beginning?

Initial string: "DAFBA"
1. No-op. We need a transition.
2. Apply rule 1: "DAFBA" -> "DAFFCA"
Now we have "DAFFCA".

We want to reach "FFCFBDAFFCA".

Let's try something different.
The goal is to obtain "FFCFBDAFFCA". Rule 3 turns this into "".
Our initial string is "DAFBA".

Maybe, rule 2, the empty string insertion, is more powerful than I thought.
If we could somehow isolate an empty string at a specific position, then applying rule 2 would introduce FB there.
But how could we create an empty string? None of the rules create empty strings.

Let me think step by step.

DAFBA -> FFCFBDAFFCA

Rule 1 replaces "B" with "FC".
Rule 2 inserts "FB" at the beginning.
Rule 3 transforms "FFCFBDAFFCA" to "".

Maybe the problem is impossible. I am going to call for John Watson' help again.
JW HELP!
