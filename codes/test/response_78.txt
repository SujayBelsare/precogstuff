Okay, let's solve this Sed Puzzle Game problem.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"
Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "B7FCD61".
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
List of transitions: [1]

Step 2: We need to get "9418FA7394B7FCD08" somehow. Let's try to get some "94"s using transition 2. Applying transition 2 is not possible since it only operates on "".

Let's rethink our strategy. We need to somehow get "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD08". It seems impossible to generate "9418FA7394B7FCD08" directly from "B7FCD08" given the transitions.  We MUST use transition 4 to reach the empty string.

Let's see if we can work backward from the target string of transition 4.
We need "9418FA7394B7FCD08". We already have "B7FCD08" after applying transition 1.
So, if we can somehow get "9418FA7394" in front of "B7FCD08", we can then apply transition 4.
We can get "94" using transition 2, but only if the string is empty.

Let's try a different approach. The goal is to eliminate the string. Transition 4 is the only way to get to the empty string.
Let's try to build the required prefix for transition 4.

We have "B7FCD08". We need to get "9418FA7394" in front. It appears there's no way to get "18FA73" without "9494" first.
Also, we can't insert anything into the middle of the string.

It looks like we are stuck. Let's review the problem statement again.
Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""
Initial string: "B7FCD61"

Okay, I see the issue. I misread the initial state. Let's try again.
Initial string: "B7FCD61"

Step 1: Apply transition 1 to "B7FCD61".
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
Transitions: [1]

We need "9418FA7394B7FCD08" to apply transition 4.  We currently have "B7FCD08".
We need to insert "9418FA7394" before "B7FCD08".

Looking at the transitions, there's no way to insert "9418FA7394".
However, if we could insert "94" twice to get "9494" then transition 3 could be used.
But we can only insert "94" if the string is empty.

Final strategy:
Apply transition 4. But we need to get the prefix.

There seems to be no way to reach the solution using the available transitions.
This puzzles me because the problem states that it is always solvable.
Let me review the transitions again.

Available transitions:
1) "61"->"08"
2) ""->"94"
3) "9494"->"18FA73"
4) "9418FA7394B7FCD08"->""

Initial string: "B7FCD61"

The only transition that shortens the string is transition 4.
Let's assume that we somehow have the string "9418FA7394B7FCD08".
Applying transition 4 will make the string "".
So, how to get this? Let's look at the end of our initial string.

Initial string: "B7FCD61"
1) "61"->"08"
"B7FCD61" -> "B7FCD08"
[1]
We want to get "9418FA7394B7FCD08" -> "".
So the last characters must match "B7FCD08".
We have "B7FCD08" now. We need to add "9418FA7394" in front of it.
We can't add to the front.

After much consideration, I believe there is an error in the problem statement or transitions provided. There's no logical way to reach "9418FA7394B7FCD08" from "B7FCD61" using the given transitions.

Because of rule #3 "It is mathematically proven that all problems given are solvable.", I must be missing something. I cannot proceed further without more information or clarification. I am not convinced the problem is solvable with the given transitions.
